22,Pollo Saltimbocca Con Prosciutto Di Parma,"sounds really good, right? Wrong. Basically what I got was half a chicken breast pounded out and overcooked to shoe-leather consistency, with a razor thin prosciuitto topping (not wrapping) and congealed sauce without any hint of Madeira whatsoever. Undercooked pieces of broccoli (2) and slices of squash (3) with a daub of mashed potato didnt help to round out this ensemble much either. Mozzarella, sage and shallots were a no show.",1,0,0

80,Seating,"We had to wait a couple of minutes to get seated, not because it was full but because the maître d’ was busy talking to someone in Italian. We managed to get a seat outside. The restaurant seemed busy for a weekday lunch but they had enough seats outside (and inside if we wanted).",0,1,0
81,Appetizers,"Anticipating a heavy lunch, we skipped ordering any antipasti. We were offered bread with dipping oil. The bread was very tasty and had a flavor of its own and the dipping oil had herbs in it that made it a nice starting piece.",0,0,1
82,Main Course,"My wife ordered a Penne Alla Diavola and I ordered a Ravioli Con Spinaci Di Mascarpone. In non-Italian terms, the Penne dish came with bunch of veggies most notably chunks of eggplant. My spinach ravioli was filled with ricotta cheese and came in a marinara-mascarpone sauce. The penne was good but nothing special. The spinach ravioli was good but the marinara-mascarpone sauce was heavenly. It elevated the ravioli to new levels of exuberance.",0,0,1
83,Dessert,We were already full but Yelp! reviewers had raved about the Tiramusu. The dessert came in pretty quick and was to die for. A hint of chocolate made it a tad bitter- but to good effect. Loved it.,0,0,1
