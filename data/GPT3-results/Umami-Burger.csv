4,Burger,"I had the 'regular' fell flat. Perhaps my palate isn't finely tuned enough to detect all the subtleties, but that being said, I kind of expect bold, punchy flavors from a burger. From a mechanical standpoint, the integrity of the burger patty itself was also a bit 'delicate' and had a tendency to fall apart.",1,0

29,Price,total came to $22 (!) including tip,1,0
30,Fries,"Fries arrived not even 15 minutes later, and burger just a couple minutes after that, so I can't complain about efficiency.",0,1
31,Taste of fries,"The truffle fries smelled really funky (guess I'm just not used to this particular truffle/cheese smell?), but -- at least initially -- had a great, rich flavor and overall mouth feel. Unfortunately, they were so drenched in the truffle/cheese that the flavors just became overpowering and deadening after a bit, and also there was no crispness to the fries at all; they quickly became practically a pool of mush.",1,0
32,Sauces,"Speaking of sauces... despite the Umami site bragging about special sauces, I was offered no sauces. The only sauce at my table was a squeeze bottle of ketchup.",1,0
33,Burger,"my hamburger was perfectly cooked and juicy, but 100% unsauced. My initial bite was 'huh? where's the flavor?!'",1,0
34,Bun,Just serviceable. Don't get all the excitement over a 'U' stamped on the top (which I read about but didn't even notice). Are we that bored in our lives that this sort of thing delights us? :p,1,0

52,Price,The sodas were pricey at $3 a pop. Total came to $48 with tip for the 2 of us. My bottom line: Worth trying for the experience but not a great value for the price.,1,0
53,Burgers,The burgers are tasty and interesting but hard to pick up to eat as the well loaded burger contents tend to fall/squish out. In & Out burgers are not as gourmet but they are tasty too and hit the spot for ~ $10 for 2 people with fries instead of a salad but burgers loaded with extra lettuce & extra tomato.,0,1
