15,Customer service,"The hostess Jade approached us at the bar and started telling us about seating us and the menu. One of my friends was talking to another person in our party and happened to be standing next to the waitress. She turned over to him and put her hand 3 inches away from his face and told him 'Excuse, I'm talking!' In other words, telling him to shut up. She walked away and heard our conversation that I was upset about her treating us the way she did and she came up with an attitude and said 'Are you staying or leaving? because if your leaving I have other people that can sit at the bar where your sitting!'  I couldn't believe that again she talked to us like that. I turned to her and said 'that was really rude. We came here to eat and that's how you welcome people into the restaurant. No one is drunk here and we're not your typical drunk customers so how you acted was really rude and we won't be eating here.' She then with a sarcastic smile said 'That's great, I'm sorry but it's been a hectic night' I told her well it doesn't give you the right to treat us that way. She gave me a sarcastic smile again and said 'Well, I'm sorry but are you leaving, I have other people to seat?!' I was so fed up with her attitude. I just asked for her name and I took my group of 9 and we left. On our way out I saw her high five the Security. So rude!",1,0
