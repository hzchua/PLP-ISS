18,Roka,"The service, bizarrely, feels more like Olive Garden - friendly, but way too clingy; the staff too preoccupied in telling you their name to coordinate on whether anyone had taken your order",1,0,0

Second course was the Prime Beef Filet with Chili Ginger Sauce that was just juicy, tender, and perfectly seasoned with a perfectly complementary dipping sauce. I picked the Yuzu and Fresh Berry Pavlova for dessert, since you really canâ€™t go wrong with fresh berries, especially if you find something similar to a giant macaroon underneath all of it",0,0,1
