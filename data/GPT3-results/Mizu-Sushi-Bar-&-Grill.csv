41,Service,"lunch time service is quick, our waitress did a great job she had all 4 orders served at the same time ( she brought a assistant to help serve all the orders at once, nice job ) they have not 1 or 2 sushi chefs but 5 and for dinner they up to 7 sushi chefs not including the full staff they have working in the kitchen serving up some of the side dishes ( like rice, soups, salads, drinks, etc.) If you go on Friday or Saturday after 6pm expect a little wait, but even though the place is busy the wait is not very long the service is still purity quick and that really surprised me",0,1
