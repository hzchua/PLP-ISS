30,Service,"Santos, our waiter came by. He said he didnt see us but its hard to miss 2 people at a table surrounded by empty tables, when the rest of the tables in the restaurant were full. Doesnt make any sense to me.",1,0
31,Food,jambalaya was sub-par. Was nice and piping hot but thats the only thing I can complement NOLA on. My girlfriends ribeye was delicious looking but that wasnt the case. It was room temperature at best and it had very rubbery parts to it which I dont recall any prime steaks Ive had before having that. The sides of spinach and mashed potatoes tasted like they were frozen at one point.,1,0
