15,Waiting time,"Waited for an hour for a table, booths are just low brow and unmanageable if someone inside needs to leave for any reason. Finally got seated, waited another 10 minutes for a waiter",1,0
16,Service,"20 minutes later other people bring out our main courses followed by our drink orders, NEVER GOT OUR SALADS. I asked for the manager! She introduced us to another waiter when she explained that the first waiter had not been working out. Evident by the good service everyone else was getting around us! But the new waiter never returned at all. I knew we would never get any re-fills on our drinks. Then, way after we had finished eating, the first waiter showed up and asked if we would like re-fills.",1,0
