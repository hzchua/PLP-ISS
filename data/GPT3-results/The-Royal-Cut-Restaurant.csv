1,Portion size,"I'm not a big eater but sometimes I order the larger one and have what is left over for lunch the next day. (I don't even have to heat it up, just grab it right out of the refrigerator and start munching....that is how delicious and tender it is, Mmmmmm)",0,1

43,Food,"high-priced, low quality, and inferior service. Steaks are chewy like rubbers, tough meat, tasteless, worse than Denny's, especially the prime ribs ($22.95 for only 8 oz one regular cut), which is thin, tastes like plainly boiled. A soup is priced at $14.95 and up, which is worth less than $3 each.",1,0
44,Service,"The waitress Judy never came to check our food, or to fill our glasses. She took 25 mins. to get our A1 sauce. We had to wait 15 mins. to bring our bill. When I brought it to the owner's attention, all he could say, 'Sorry!' We make sure to him not to come back again. He cared less. We were ripped off and did not deserved for the inferior service either.",1,0
