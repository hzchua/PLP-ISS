33,Service,"a large group (7 people) from Europe came and sat next to us 15 minutes later & after waiting for 35 minutes, the Europe group received all of their food before my friend and I did. Even after bringing it up to the waiter, we still didn't get our food for another 12 minutes (I watched my clock closely this time), which is why you do not tip prior to receiving your food/service",1,0
