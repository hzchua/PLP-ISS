36,Waiter,old waiter first tried to talk me out of ordering the appetizer because it was going to take too long to make - he brought it out 15 minutes later. He also tried to talk me out of ordering the dessert (butter bread pudding) because it would take too long to heat - I should have listened to him.,1,0
