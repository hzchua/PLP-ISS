8,Atmosphere,"Potential spoiler for the night: an exceedingly loud group plants themselves at the table next to us, having snuck in from the pool area.",1,0
9,Service,"Heres where huge kudos go to Gina and Mike. Mike covered this unexpected addition to his already slammed night with a big smile and great attitude. The group didnt fit at the table they chose and kept bumping into me. Gina and Mike moved another table over so they had more room. Plus, when we offer we would be willing to move our table to provide even more space, Gina immediately picked up on the situation and quickly helped us move our table as far away as possible so that we didnt have screaming in our ears and were able to enjoy the last of our night.",0,1
