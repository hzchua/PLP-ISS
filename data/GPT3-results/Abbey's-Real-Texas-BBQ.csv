30,Taste,Abbeys REAL Texas BBQ is authentic tasting!,0,1
31,Quality,"It aint fast food made with processed junk, so you pay a little extra to get the real deal.",0,1
32,Flavor,"I love BBQ meats: making it myself, eating all sorts of styles and savoring unique seasonings. This one has a great smokey flavor from slow roasting/smoking, and that just cant be duplicated.",0,1
33,Value,"You get what you pay for. It is real BBQ, not fashionable, just old fashioned.",0,1
34,Recommendation,"I have gone here for years. Expect to pay ~$20 for a good sized platter that will fill you up. All the meats are great, but Im not a fan of smoked ham. The salads are large and are made to taste great. I recommend a caesar salad and the 3 meat platter to feed two adults. The home-made chili beans are even better than their home-made pinto beans. If you like a BBQ joint mainly for the good tasting food, this is the place.",0,1
