21,Food,"I was dragged here without choice.... I think the real name should be 5 Guys that tried In N Out and is trying to copy them Start up costs must be a lot, considering the burgers are like double the price of their cometitors. If I were looking to spend $6 on a burger I would go to a Full Service Restaurant... Islands or Red Robin which also include unlimited fries for the $6.-7  Fries were nothing to speak of, they offer a few more condiments on the burgers, but nothing I would order. I guess the big difference is they also sell Hot Dogs. Yippie!",0,1,0
22,Value for money,"The restaurant itself was small and cramped, we could not get to tables without making other people get up from their tables to let us by. Constantly bumping the backs of chairs together every time someone moves.",0,1,0
