31,Availability,"Ive heard about this place for awhile now but always assumed it was just opened for lunch and could never go. But then a friend told me theyre opened for dinner too and since then, its been my go-to due to conveniency. I like that they dont close in between lunch and dinner and with my weird eating schedule, I manage to fit in a bowl of ramen when its not super packed since its TINY",0,0,1
32,Habanero Ramen,"When it came out, I was very surprised that the broth was far from red and disappointed that it was barely spicy. Not habanero at all. Kimchi was very good though and egg was perfectly soft-boiled melt in your mouth delicious",1,0,0
33,Tonkatsu,I think I prefer the Tonkatsu just because the Spicy Miso was not spicy at all (I think they have to work on their spice thermometer). Pork belly is SOOO good...I love pork belly fat. I wish the noodles were better though and all their broths can get a little too salty after awhile and I just get sick of it. Definitely a worthy SF ramen place compared to others in the city though,0,0,1

59,Price,"Nine bucks later, I had my standard bowl of ramen, which wasnt any better than any ramen Ive gotten at other places in the past. Maybe Im missing something, but this was just regular old not-mindblowing ramen for a bit more than Id be willing to pay for again.",1,0,0
60,Location,"And youd think, being near chinatown, that thered be a lot of ramen options, not that ramen is chinese, but you know, at least something, so I intend to branch out eventually and find out where that ramen is.

I mean, most people are gonna be coming in with $20s, so either get more $1 and $5 bills, or start accepting credit cards",1,0,0
