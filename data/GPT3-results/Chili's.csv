20,Service,"Multiple servers walked passed, NOT one address the table, only looked. One waiter cracked a smile but still didnt stop. Then we asked one guy for help, and he gave us the wait a minute had never came back. Our server MiMi finally came after 8 minutes of sitting at a table. Never introduced herself, I had to ask. But anyhow, we her our order. I ordered a cup of ice, when she brought the cup of ice, the cup was half full, and ice was melted. Like the cup had been sitting. Worst part when she placed the glass on the table she put the palm of her hand on the rim of the glass.",1,0
