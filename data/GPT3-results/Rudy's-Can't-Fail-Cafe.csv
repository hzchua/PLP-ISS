20,Service,"It took at least ten minutes to get seated even though there were tons of open tables. When we did get a seat, it was right next to a cart full of dirty dishes. Our server took our drink orders, brought them back, went over to where the manager was apologizing to some angry customers on the servers behalf (this should have been a clue) and then just disappeared. Fifteen minutes later and no server to take our food order and I was done.",1,0
