      "Example 32: Long story short : the food was good , but the service was terrible . The waiter ' s attitude right from the start was off - putting . He seemed impatient and bothered that he had to wait on us in the first place . We were there celebrating a friend ' s wedding and had a couple table pushed together . He told us he would break the bills up by table , so I asked if he could instead break it up by family . They weren ' t very busy at the time , but he responded that it was more work for him and would take more time . I responded that I didn ' t want to inconvenience him , which was all he needed to hear . I guess I should have just been grateful that I got his service at all . The day was cool but sunny , so we decided to put the umbrella up at our table . The waiter came out while I started fiddling with it , at which point he said \" I ' ll take care of it . \" He must have misunderstood what I was doing , because he didn ' t put the umbrella up . I asked him if he was planning on extending the umbrella , to which he responded , \" I don ' t have the authority to do that - I ' ll have to check with the manager . \" I asked him to please do that , and a few moments later , a manager came out . He was pleasant at first . Here ' s how the conversation went : Manager - \" I understand you would like the umbrella raised . \" Me - \" Yes please . The sun is a little too much for the kiddos . \" Manager - \" You understand that the temperature will drop about 25 degrees if I put it up , right ? \" Me - \" Yep . That ' s no problem , thanks . \" ( and I truly appreciated the warning , so everything still going well ) Manager - \" Ok , I ' ll put it up , but once it goes up , just understand that I ' m not taking it back down . \" WHOA ! What are we , children ? You have to talk down to us ? I wasn ' t asking for him to move the world . It only took about a minute to put the thing up , and yet he was acting like it was a huge ordeal ! Plus , I could have sworn that we were customers , and that they were to serve us , not be inconvenienced by us . My blood was boiling , but I didn ' t want to ruin everyone else ' s experience and decided not to make a scene . I was further angered about 10 minutes later when that same manager came out to another table for another umbrella request , yet only offered the temperature warning and no mention of his \" once it goes up , it stays up \" policy . As I said above , the food was pretty good , and I ' m not going to give them a bad review without at least being fair about the rest of the experience . However , the lunch was pretty much ruined for me right after the experience with the manager , and I was in a bad mood the rest of the time . I contemplated saying something to someone , but if that was the manager , to whom could I speak unless maybe an owner was around . In any case , I was so mad that I didn ' t want to get into a shouting match . When I received the bill , the waiter was all smiles , of course . After splitting everything up between tables OURSELVES , I left a generous < 10 % tip ( seriously contemplated zero ) , and left a note on the back of the receipt explaining that patrons should not ever feel like they are a burden or a nuisance , and that is how we felt that we were treated . I also vowed to write a review and post it everywhere , as well as email to the restaurant , so here it is . If you ' re like me , reviews like this are enough to turn me to the next restaurant . If not , I hope you don ' t have the same experience .\n",

      "Example 47: The success of any mediocre sushi joint relies heavily on the ability to keep its clientele content with alcoholic drinks . What can be said about Miyake ' s Palo Alto can definitely be applied here . Fool me once , shame on you , fool me twice . . . well you know how it goes . Strike One : If you ' re a sushi restaurant receiving 4 or 5 star reviews , you should damn well know how to make rice the proper way . My sushi rice was smooshed with most grains flattened . Sushi 101 : learn how to fold your rice properly while cooling it down . Strike Two : The Salmon definitely tasted more than 4 days old . Strike Three : FOOD POISONING ! A dozen oyster beauties for $ 22 . Not too shabby but not a blue - light special either . Not only did I get the taste of shell and salt ( see Oyster Shuck / Prep 101 ) , but I also got a side of the runs and vomiting from subsequent food poisoning . Please get your oysters from a trusted source next time . Ugh , this venue was certainly not worth the fever and uncontrollable discharges . BEWARE : FOOD POISONING . I ' d much rather grab sushi from Mitsuwa or Nijiya than eat at this joint .\n",
      "Example 48: I ' m usually really grateful for sexual favors , but somehow during my 2 hour dinner there the waitress must have given me a quick lap dance to account for the $ 40 discrepancy on my credit card statement ( Thank god for Amex fraud protection to resolve the issue ) . As inclined as I am to let that experience motivate me to give this place a hearty one star , I have to give credit where its due to the folks in the kitchen . We went there for a birthday dinner party of 10 and was accommodated in a charming nook upstairs . The drink list had a variety and the bartender made my Long Island 5 parts alcohol just the way I like it . If there are any two items on the menu to get it ' s the Baby Back Ribs and the Fried Potatoes with parmesan and truffle oil aka julienne french fries . The Baby Back Ribs were sooo tender . I had also ordered the Seared Spiced Ahi Tuna as a starter but was mildly impressed . Likewise for the Salmon Roulade w / leeks and goat cheese in a saffron vinaigrette . If I could do it again , I probably would have gotten a full oder of the Baby Back Ribs . This is the perfect place for a birthday dinner , just remember to pay cash ! Also if you ' re coming in around the dinner rush hour , you might wait ~ 15 minutes after your actual reservation time due to limited seating .\n",
      "Example 49: Absolutely great food at a great value ! My roommate raved about this restaurant and I have never been one for Vietnamese fusion but this place did it right . My evening ' s plan of attack : Roasted Quail and Ha Long Bay Soup for appetizers - the waitress kept stressing the importance of squeezing the lime over the salt and pepper which did make the difference when not eaten with the Quail and the Ha Long Bay was a nice little twist on traditional Thai Tom Kha Gai soup . Shaking Beef and Com Dep Halibut - Shaking beef was pretty good , but the Halibut was great ! I ' m partial to Ong Choy aka Vietnamese Water Spinach but the fish was cooked perfect and most but flakey . Side of Empress rice - the waitress raved about this one but I thought it was so - so and thought the entrees each had plentiful sides . I would definitely recommend this as a nice second date place . I ' ll have to make it over sometime for the half off happy hours .\n",

The chefs speak Japanese and the nigiri menu is extensive , with some bites being seasonal . I will bring back a date and order some rolls , next time . This place puts the attention on the food and not the decor or \" costume \" image so many competitors in the area try to draw with . I only wonder if they have omakase ?

I ’ ll have to say that while their dishes seemed to be fairly pleasing look - wise , I wasn ’ t too impressed by the Lauriat that I ordered . Their standard Chinese restaurant selections were not that great ; the Beef and Broccoli dish lacked sauce and the Orange Chicken meal seemed too gummy . Once I tried their more unconventional dishes , they actually impressed me . Spicy lamb was a favorite of mine , the lamb was tender and cooked very well . They had some strange chicken noodle dish on the menu as well which I tried another time . Another success .

I certainly wouldn ' t drive to Compton for this food , but if a friend wanted to drive there again and bring me back food if I paid him for it ( as happened this time ) , I would probably accept that offer .\n",
      "Example 110: Me and a friend were just here , tried the 10 dollar buffet .

Not quite the best Indian food I ' d had , but it was certainly above average . Was above average in the number of available dishes in the buffet , too . I ' m happy to have finally found a good Indian place in Long Beach - Taste of India is bland , Kamal Palace is just terrible , and while the food at Natraj was quite good , their service was rather scatterbrained . This place , at least when we were there , had good food - and - pretty good service . The free tea was nice of them , too , even if I would have wished it was chilled rather than hot . But it ' s free , so I can ' t complain , really . On the other hand , I will mention we went back later to try their \" naan pizza \" , cause seriously , naan pizza ? Sounds amazing , right ? Well , it - was - rather tasty , but not that large for the price , and took a crazy long time to arrive . Not getting that again , even if it was pretty delicious . edit : I ' ve been back for their buffet a couple more times since I posted that . Nothing ' s changed , really , I just thought I should mention that it ' s still just as good . MAJOR EDIT : their buffet is permanently gone now , sadly . Their food is still good , but we went this morning expecting to get the buffet , and couldn ' t . The amount of food you get per dollar just isn ' t nearly as impressive , ordering entrees off the menu ( especially not the curry I had , which was pretty good , but tiny . ) Still probably the best Indian place in Long Beach , but no longer by as much .\n",
      "Example 111: So , this is obviously not a cheap place to eat , but I ' m going to go out on a limb and say that it was still totally worth it , at least if you want to stay within the park , and if you ' re there for lunch . I hadn ' t eaten here in forever , but I was back last weekend , and the monte cristo sandwich was just as good as I remembered - it was also much * bigger * than I remembered . After eating the provided bread ( a sweet potato and cheddar bread that was mindblowingly good , and which they gave us more of when we asked for it , at no charge ) , the cup of also quite tasty soup , and with the side of also quite tasty scalloped potatos and turnips ( and I ' m picky about turnips ) . . . and seriously a sandwich that looked like it was two entire sandwiches . . . I could only finish about 3 / 4s of it . Service was also better than I remembered from previous visits - I didn ' t remember it - not - being good , but I also didn ' t remember them refilling our drinks and asking if we needed anything every couple of minutes , and giving us whatever we wanted . So , for my meal , I ' d say it was totally worth the price . ( Speaking of , 4 dollars for unlimited mint juleps as long as you ' re eating , is almost worth it to come here by itself , given that Disney fake mint juleps are super tasty , and it ' s the same price you pay for one cup , outside . ) My girlfriend ' s 35 dollar a plate short ribs , on the other hand . . . well , they were also extremely good , but * I * wouldn ' t have paid 35 dollars for them . I guess she was happy enough , though . The feel of the place is probably better by dinner , when you don ' t have noonday sun pouring in from the main doors , but . . . I would take the monte cristo ( and it probably being a little less crazy crowded , though you still definitely want to call in a few days ahead ) over that . Oh , yeah , and we got a table by the water on request - they said it would be 15 minutes , it was actually only about 10 . It was kind of a lame table - by - the - water , with a tree in between us and the boats , but still .\n",

It ' s pricy and the dress should be elegant and at least business casual . Suit and tie is common . Dress pants and a dress shirt will work , but you should probably add a suit jacket or sports coat . Or no jacket but wear a tie instead .

I wanted to get Dad in and started so we didn ' t have to be here so long - he takes a while . My father ' s legs are very weak and while it ' s good to get him out to lunch as much as possible , he ' s only good for a trip in and a trip out . The small man said they could bring a chair over and sit him right in the middle of the worst traffic but we had to decline and leave as the small man wouldn ' t listen to anything I had to say . He kept cutting me off with , \" It ' s our policy . \" I had to rush my father back out to the car before his legs gave out and he fell down . He ' d already been standing too long as it was - waiting for the little man to finish his display of complete and utter control , allowing absolutely no consideration for my father ' s wellbeing - or mine , for that matter . Being a 24 / 7 caregiver to a parent with Alzheimer ' s is extremely stressful - this was our only day out in over a month . The day was blown and we just went home .

I ate that out of the container ) , DUCK tots , salty sweet & spicy mixed nuts , . Also tasty was the ginger drink , hangar steak salad ( medium rare ) , honey lime grilled chicken salad , and the grilled hearts of romaine caesar salad . Everything was licked clean .

As for main courses , I have tried the pot pie , the roasted chicken , and burger . The roasted chicken was nothing to get excited about , but I definitely recommend the pot pie and burger .

My friends got the chicken and waffles , loco moco , a side of truffle fries with a trio of sauces , Dynamo donut ( yes they serve it here ) and simple eggs , sausages and roasted potatoes dish . Sunnyside Joe ' s really hit the spot . The dish came out beautifully crafted , prepped and tasted like the best comfort food I ' ve always imagined . Starbelly offers a pretty large portion so my friends and I were able to share our food tapa style .

My boyfriend and I stopped in to have dinner and drinks in your bar . I inquired to the bartender that my phone was dying and was there a convenient location for me to charge it while we ate . He kindly stated he could charge it behind the bar securely next to the cashwrap . When we went to retrieve the phone after leaving , we were handed back ONLY the charger , not the phone . This was a brand new Iphone 5S with 2 months worth of data and content backed up over a 9 year period . We spoke with the MOD , the bartender and were informed that security cameras could identify the culprit , although that was never done . Instead we were told to wait until the next day when we would be contacted again by the MOD , Jonathon Young . We contacted Jonathon the next day and he assured us he would take care of the matter and that we would be reimbursed for the phone since it was clearly stolen from one of your employees . ( The bar area is supposed to be secure with only the bartender and bar back entering the secured area . ) Several emails to Mr . Young proved unfruitful . I finally received a phone call from Heather Conry , on January 8 . I called her back the same day and left a message as I was traveling . I called her back again and again , and my boyfriend also called left her repeated messages . She likely has over 6 messages between us . It ' s unconscionable to me why she would reach out initially and then have ZERO follow through . Im not sure what kind of management team you are running there , but it ' s unacceptable behavior .

I was a little reluctant about coming here since it had a wide spread of reviews , but I decided to order something off the menu that was pancake / waffle related due to this place being called stacks , and hey , I had a fabulous experience . I got to try the blueberry pancakes and the chocolate waffle and both were spectacular . I looooove that they use real blueberries in their pancakes , and each bite was a burst of flavor . I also was a huge fan of the fact that the chocolate waffle wasn ' t too overpowering in its chocolate chip - ness . Sometimes with chocolate themed breakfasts they go a bit overboard and you get tired of the flavor after a few bites , but the ratio was excellent and I would highly recommend it .

      "Example 467: Terrible , terrible , TERRIBLE experience . I was thinking of using this restaurant for my rehearsal dinner , and I had a meeting set up with the manager . I showed up a little early to my meeting ( 5 min . ) and I walked in only to have the servers telling me that they had no clue when the manager was going to be in . I excused this initial encounter as a potential miscommunication , and decided to take a walk in the area and come back at the time of the appointment . When I came back , the manager was still not there , and no one would give me any information . I sat there for 15 minutes until the chef finally noticed me and asked what I was there for and he called the manager who was not there . He proceeded to tell me that the manager would be there in 10 minutes ( a . k . a . 25 minutes after our meeting time ) . I decided to wait in hopes that my experience would improve when the manager arrived , and 10 minutes later he still wasn ' t there . . After 45 minutes of waiting , the manager strolls in and completely ignores me . The chef points him in my direction and he shakes my hand and says \" the traffic was bad , so what are we meeting about ? \" I was furious , but this was at the time the only place I had really looked into for my rehearsal dinner venue , so I continued with the conversation . I asked him about the food and what dishes he could have for us and his response was \" Everyone loves our food . Only one person has ever rated our food below 5 stars . Look at our website . \" Um , buddy , you don ' t have 5 stars on yelp . Maybe you should stop pulling just the good reviews , and take a look at why people are unhappy with you . It became evident that this man was clearly not someone that I wanted anywhere near my special day . He was disrespectful , rude and unbelievably unreliable . I have never been so offended by an experience at a restaurant . I honestly couldn ' t care less how good or not good their food is . With staff that does not care even in the slightest about the people who come in to eat or who they want to host events for , I will never ever be caught dining here .\n",

I ordered the a bacon and eggs plate and substituted the toast that came with the meal for a Cookies ' n Cream pancake since I wanted to try something more adventurous as well . My husband had the bread pudding french toast and that was delicious . If we come back , I definitely would order that since it was delicious . My favorite part of the dish was that it was well balanced since it came with bacon and eggs . I thought it was well priced as well . Although it wasn ' t my favorite brunch place in the bay , I definitely plan on coming back and I ' m determined to find a dish that I will become addicted to . : )\n",
      "Example 469: When I initially saw Umami had opened up a location in Palo Alto , I was ecstatic . Umami burgers are delicious and perfect from the ingredients to the presentation . I was surprised to see that the reviews for this place were so mediocre , and I came in really wanting to like this spot , but alas , the yelp reviews were right - this place falls below the typical Umami experience . I walked in and the decor threw me off right away . I thought it was clever that they made it look like a library , but they took it to a very literal level to where it looked a bit dumpy . However , I ' m not one to judge a location by its looks since the food is much more important to me , so I tried not to let this sway my opinion . The next thing was that service was beyond slow . It took us 15 minutes after we asked for water to have it brought over . Our waitress was kind about it and tried to brush how slow she was off with humor , but after a while it became annoying . I also usually get a beer when I come to Umami since it just feels like the right thing to do , but they had nothing on tap which turned that into a beyond costly endeavor , so I opted not to go down that path . At this point , my excitement had started to dwindle down , but then came the food and I was really still holding onto my hopes for it to be delicious . I ordered the truffle burger , truffle fries and tempura ' d onion rings . The truffle burger ' s bun was a bit off ( this is usually one of my favorite parts of Umami with the toasted buns ) , the meat itself was good so overall , 4 stars for the burger . The truffle fries looked as though they were in a bath of sauce which turned them from delicious to soggy in a matter of minutes . The onion rings were delicious . The other thing that is special about most Umami burgers is that they make their ketchup , but here it tasted really watery . Overall , I think they are still working out some kinks since they are relatively new . I have high hopes that this place will keep getting better and better . One awesome touch that they had was letting you walk around university ave while you waited since they text you when your table is ready . I really liked that and wish that more restaurants had this level of flexibility .\n",

I always come in here with the mindset that I want to try something completely new , so I ' ve tried quite the range of beers . All of the hefeweizens are delicious , so if you aren ' t a huge fan of beer , I recommend starting with those . Just be prepared since the glasses are huge and each drink feels like a meal .

      "Example 472: The beer is wonderful , the food is pretty good but the staff is just sad . . . I really wanted to like this place , but mistake after mistake really put a bad taste in my mouth . We arrived for a team happy hour and had reserved a table . The person who took our reservation * ensured * that we would be outside , which a lot of us were excited about . Turns out their entire patio is under construction . . Doesn ' t really sound like something that would be a difficult thing to know . On top of that , they didn ' t have a table ready for our group . It would have almost been easier not making a reservation and avoiding the confusion . Then , we ordered food for the table and almost all of the orders were messed up or missing . Our waiter was difficult to find after the initial order , and when we grabbed someone else to ask for help 1 ) they looked terrified that we were asking them a question 2 ) they said they would take care of it but did not . Not a very good experience there . Luckily , most of the food was pretty decent . I was a particular fan of their meatballs . I was pretty discouraged after those first two happenings , but I ordered the dark beer flight and crossed my fingers that it would be good . The waiter had spilled a good amount of the beer onto the plate that held the tastings , but after everything else that had happened , I was just happy to have my beer finally . Lucky for them , the beer was incredible , which helped push them up from a 1 or 2 star review up to 3 . It was good enough to make me consider coming back . Overall - if you are going to give this place a shot I recommend that you come during happy hour since certain food items and beers are half off and that you come with a huge bucket of patience since you will certainly need it . The staff is not particularly knowledgable about beer , so you also might want to have your smartphone handy to do some on the spot research . : )\n",

However , to our delight , when we were called for seating , we had a lovely table next to the water ! The beginning of a perfect meal at Blue Bayou . We both had the Buccaneer ' s Boneless Beef Short Ribs . They ' ll melt in your mouth and were absolutely wonderful ! Our waiter was friendly , professional and attentive . People state this restaurant is over - priced , but compared to the horrible Steakhouse 55 , this is a much better value with better quality food , and less pretension ! The only suggestion I could make is to improve the area for customers who have checked in and are awaiting seating .\n",

Glad we did ! Great service , wonderful food , reasonable prices ! The carnitas nachos are fantastic ! We may try Sur again at some point if it is still open and they figure out a way to hire someone who knows how to smile and greet guests properly . The people at the restaurant next door were able to confirm that a lot of the employees at Sur have attitudes ( big surprise ) . I think we dodged a bullet there .

      "Example 624: I had lunch there two days ago and I can say in all frankness that I don ' t intend to get back there anytime soon . The food was ok - ish and the service was not stellar . But what got my attention was that little extra $ 18 I found on the check when I wanted to pay . I went up to the register and asked what that was for . The waitress turned around to the owner and went like \" Oh , remember , that was when I made a mistake and I forgot to correct it \" . Riiiiiight . Instead of re - doing the check , she just handed me a $ 20 bill that covered for it and told us to sign the erroneous check , which we did two minutes later when we me and my guest wanted to leave . Call me judgmental , but when someone doesn ' t apologize , tries to tell a cover story on the spot and can only find the quickest and dirtiest way to make up for it ( as in \" let ' s forget about all this \" ) , that means they ' re lying . But things got worst . When we stood up from our chairs , the owner grabbed us and said that we should start all over again and print a new check with the proper amount and that we should give back the $ 20 . Why is it that she changed her mind , I didn ' t know , but it seemed like the correct way to make it right in the first place . I said ok , suddenly understanding exactly what was going to happen : she took back the bank note and the previous check and printed a new one without the extra $ 18 and had us sign it . And what I thought was going to happen happened : she didn ' t give back the previously signed check and I had to request myself that she give it back to us . Now , all I can assume is that since me and my guess were speaking a foreign language all lunch long , she must have thought we were tourists who wouldn ' t care to look at the check or wouldn ' t dare to ask . What she didn ' t know was that I live in the Bay Area and also speak fluent English , which definitely helped in the resolution of the matter . Looking at Carmel and seeing the standard of living of most people and tourists around , that ' s definitely not something I ' d have expected to happen there . Lesson learned . In short , don ' t go there unless you feel like taking a look at your check and checking your bank statement the following month .\n",

      "Example 728: Roka is one of my favourite restaurants in London . Apparently the chain started expanding globally , but then split in to . The original Roka has London and everything East , Roka Akor took everything West , including the US . On the surface , the restaurant is very similar - modern Japanese food , with a focus on Robatayaki . Indeed , the open kitchen layout with multi - tier iron grill is identical , likewise the surrounding bar hewn from an impressively large cross section of a tree . Dig a little deeper , however , and the similarities start to fall away . The cuisine , while modern , lacks the edge , complexity and variety of the original - though the top tier prices stay the same . The service , bizarrely , feels more like Olive Garden - friendly , but way too clingy ; the staff too preoccupied in telling you their name to coordinate on whether anyone had taken your order . Likewise , the heavy , visible pushing of their gift cards seems more suited to a restaurant several tiers below their price point . Descending from the restaurant into their basement bar transports you from an interior that could just about compete with their London namesake , to somewhere that feels like a generic , though upscale , hotel . On the positive side , the menu does feature a decent selection of beers from Japanese microbreweries , which I ' ve not seen elsewhere . If you ' re looking for this kind of food , but don ' t mind skipping the financial district crowd , you ' d be better off going to Izakaya Sozai .\n",

As insanely busy as he was , he never made me feel rushed to make wine / menu choices or to vacate the table . My burger was amazing . One of the best I ' ve had in the city . The wine was tasty . And , Mike , with his charming personality , happily gave my friend and I plenty of space and time to catch up . Potential spoiler for the night : an exceedingly loud group plants themselves at the table next to us , having snuck in from the pool area . Here ' s where huge kudos go to Gina and Mike . Mike covered this unexpected addition to his already slammed night with a big smile and great attitude . The group didn ' t fit at the table they chose and kept bumping into me . Gina and Mike moved another table over so they had more room . Plus , when we offer we would be willing to move our table to provide even more space , Gina immediately picked up on the situation and quickly helped us move our table as far away as possible so that we didn ' t have screaming in our ears and were able to enjoy the last of our night . In one visit , this place has become a favorite . I know I will be back ( with a reservation , next time ) and I look forward to seeing both Gina and Mike . They made a fun evening even better !\n",

When you get in , the mirrors and the furniture confirm that feeling and we felt it badly needs a refreshment . The restaurant is noisy , tables are a little bit too close from each other in my opinion and the tableware not that elegant . . . But hey , we are here for the food ! So our Gary Danko experience started with a double thumb up : a superbly cooked sweetbread and a rich , smooth and creative ahi tuna with avocado . Our expectations were very high and after the entr é es , we were sure they would be fulfilled . While we were just watering our mouth for what had to come , it came . A mediocre soft shell crab ( too many confusing and – in my opinion – badly assorted tastes ) was followed by an equally mediocre juniper bison ( the juniper crust was plainly burnt and the meat was chewy and stringy ) and a well prepared but not exceptional lamb ( at least it did not look very good to me ) . Dessert was OK , just that . The service is attentive , but I really did not get it why the maitre d ’ kept trying to fill my glass up to 5 / 6 of its capacity despite many hints that I liked just half , and our waiter poured red wine in my champagne glass ( and on the tablecloth ) . In view of what you pay , this was a poor experience .\n",

      "Example 950: There are not many fast food options in this part of SOMA when you want to get something quick to eat ( other options being Crepes a Go - Go and DNA cafe ) .

Traffic was bad so we arrived exactly 15 minutes after the reservation was scheduled . When she finally acknowledged us , it was barely 20 minutes after our reservation time . Because she didn ' t get to us in time , she said she gave away our table because check in time according to her watch was when she was able to wait on us ( we checked in with her side kick right at the wire , but she was spineless and wouldn ' t say a word to the nazi reservation girl ) . Needless to say , her attitude and the way she spoke to me was a total deal killer . I wish I had her name so I could let everyone know how poor her customer service is . I will NEVER EVER go to this location ever again . I should ' ve listened to everyone who told me not to go . Bottom line is if she had treated us with respect , we would ' ve stayed and waited for the next table . Someone needs to give this girl a lesson in customer service .

I arrived first with my two children ( 3 & 15 ) , we were seated promptly , the waitress was friendly . About 15 minutes my friend Terri arrived . We ordered a wonderful breakfast for all , ate & enjoyed conversation . My friend paid the bill & tipped the waitress , all was fine , then my 15 yr old son decided to show my friend some of his magic tricks , while my friend finished her muffin & drink . He took out his deck of cards & proceeded to do a few magic tricks ( quietly not bothering anyone ) . About 10 minutes in the waitress came back to our table and said , \" If I can ' t get you anything else , I ' m going to have to ask you to leave \" . Our jaws dropped , I ' m sure of it . Seeing the expression of surprise on my face , she then said , \" well it is Sunday \" , \" we are very busy today , there are people waiting \" . We looked around & nearby was an open booth & a open table . If people were waiting then why were there open tables nearby ? The waitress came back to our table a few minutes later & said , \" did I say something to upset you \" ? \" I could see from the look on your face that something maybe is wrong \" . I told her that never in my life had I been asked to leave a restaurant because \" they were too busy \" . Yes this was extremely offensive to me . She apologized & reiterated that it was a busy morning . On our way out we approached the owner , told him what had happened , and he backed his waitress 100 % . He did not care that we had actually been asked to leave . I will miss their delicious tuna melt but it is not worth the lack of common courtesy .

Tonight as an added bonus I didn ' t even get the potatoes that come with the parmeasan crusted chicken . . When speaking to Rich , he claimed to have taken the order as well as packed the order , and insisted that is how it was ordered and proceeded to argue with me about the order in addition to the initial attitude he had upon answering my call . This place is a joke and if you really want BJ ' s take the extra drive to Temecula . I can say I will NEVER frequent this place again . As for Rich and BJ ' s management staff , get some training in customer service . If one of my employees acted like this to a customer , they would not have a job ! ! !\n",

Then we took the \" Lemon Pepper Duck Breast with Duck Hash , Bacon Braised Endive and Port Glazed Figs \" and the \" Seared Filet of Beef with Cumin Potatoes , Swiss Chard , Tomato - Corn Relish and Basil Butter \" for main course . Both meats were exceptional . We finished with the \" Baked Chocolate Soufflé with Two Sauces \" and the \" Chocolate Praline Parfait with Bourbon Sauce and Salted Caramel Ice Cream \" . Both deserts were the best ones I have ever got in a US restaurant and very close to some high end French ones . Three little details that could have been better : room a bit noisy and the seating was a bit awkward as it was moving when other persons were seating and moving . Last , the price for the two Rose Champagne glasses was a tad exaggerated .\n",
      "Example 1172: I went here with a group of people and we did have a good \u001b[32m<time:Positive Confidence:0.9803146123886108>\u001b[0m . However the \u001b[31m<food:Negative Confidence:0.9897805452346802>\u001b[0m was not great ( i tried 4 different items that night ) , but the \u001b[32m<portions:Positive Confidence:0.99899822473526>\u001b[0m are big . Our \u001b[32m<waiter:Positive Confidence:0.999527096748352>\u001b[0m was new but fun . I will not be going back to this restaurant again . My wife and I both feel this way .\n",
      "Example 1173: The only reason I ' m not giving this place a better than ' good ' grade is because a friend and I went there ( party of 2 ) and ordered 2 regular dishes on the menu . A large group ( 7 people ) from Europe came and sat next to us 15 minutes later & after waiting for 35 minutes , the Europe group received all of their food before my friend and I did . Even after bringing it up to the waiter , we still didn ' t get our food for another 12 minutes ( I watched my clock closely this time ) , which is why you do not tip prior to receiving your food / service . Otherwise I must give this place excellent on their fod because despite the fact that my friend and I were beyond parched upon receiving our food , it was phenomenal . The salmon benedict is the best I ' ve ever eaten at Cafe Flore .\n",
      "Example 1174: We visited here the first time for my birthday , and I was so glad we went ! The restaurant is beautiful , and the atmosphere is great with the roving mariachi players , who even gave my toddler a maraca to play along . The food was somewhat Americanized and slightly less spicy than typical Mexican fare , but to me it tasted amazing and I loved their different spins on Mexican food , like the chicken , avocado and mango burrito I ordered and thoroughly enjoyed . It ' s a little pricier than most Mexican restaurants , but well worth it . We will definitely be visiting again !\n",

      "Example 1179: In short ; great atmosphere , great food , and great service . My wife and I ate here for the first time last night on a date and I must say that I was extremely impressed . The restaurant itself has inviting , yet rustic decor and an overall fun atmosphere . Our waitress was very friendly and very helpful when it came to answering questions about menu items . The restaurant was very busy during our visit , but our waitress was still very attentive . She returned to our table after it had been a bit since we placed our order to assure us that the food would be out shortly . We assured her we weren ' t worried about it and that we understood because of how busy the restaurant was . When our food finally came it was delivered by a manager and he also apologized for the wait . The food itself was delicious , the only real complaint we had was that they use a fairly soft tofu in their wok dishes , which typically feature a more firm tofu , but otherwise the food was really good .\n",

I ordered the biscuits and gravy which was delicious , except it came out a little on the cold side , but my waitress quickly heated it up for me . My son had the cinnamon roll and was a disappointed that it had nuts in it ( kind of wish the menu explained that ) . But our waitress came back and checked on us and noticed the frown on his face and asked he wanted something else ( she must have kids too ) . He decided on the blueberry pancakes and the waitress even put some whip cream on the pancakes ( nice touch ! ) . Overall a very nice experience . The staff is excellent , and place is very clean , and the bathrooms are beautiful ! Prices a bit on the high side , but for if your looking for a treat , I recommend CORKYS ! .\n",
      "Example 1189: Horrible experience , first time visit lured in by their \" Valentine ' s Special \" which had been extended due to a kitchen fire , and we chose to come here to celebrate a birthday . Upon arrival waitress Holly was unfriendly and looked like she just got up , we asked for the Valentine ' s special and was promptly told it had ended a couple of days before . I showed her the email that THIS location had sent us which clearly outlined that the expiration date was at least one more day away and was told \" that it ' s only for participating locations \" once again I pointed to the email which clearly came from the Haun location and was told that the kitchen fire did not allow them to prepare the FRIED appetizers . . . . . asked for a raincheck and was quickly told NO RAINCHECKS . . . . . This is clearly a strong case for false advertising . . . . waitress never offered to consult management about \" making good \" on their offer and when we asked for an appetizer platter was AGAIN told that this particular item was not available , by now it seemed clear that hispanic / asian patrons are not welcome here and the only time she even cracked a smile was when we asked for the check .

      "Example 1338: If you ' re feeling like you want a treat or bad - for - you food , this carnival theme restaurant hits the spot . I tried the Chicken & Waffles Monte Cristo sandwich with some sweet potato tots . I only ate half because it was so decadent . Their coffee was good and was served in Hawaiian Hilo Hattie Mugs . Service was attentive and I ' d go back for brunch if in the neighborhood .\n",
      "Example 1339: It feels like you ' re in when dining here with a friend for a casual meal . I ' ve been here many times for both lunch and dinner . My favs are the Chicken Pot Pie , Enchiladas , Hummus and Salads . I ' ve also had their steak at dinner and found it somewhat underwhelming . Drinks are on the pricey side , but wines are reasonable . They have a few locations around the city for a solid meal !\n",
      "Example 1340: I ' v e only been to this classic University Ave . Modern Vietnamese restaurant for Happy Hour . It ' s actually pretty cool because all apps are half off . You can make a pretty decent meal for two by splitting a whole bunch of appetizers . The decor and service are really standout here . We got the Tamarine Taste , Banh Mi Roti , Salt and Pepper Calamari and the Char Siu Steamed Buns . I ' d definitely come back to try the entrees . I just got back from a food adventure all around Vietnam and some of the bites really transported me back to the streets there . Not all of it is authentic , but the twists are a nice surprise here and there . But that $ 15 Pho looks horribly overpriced . . .\n",
      "Example 1341: I was a first timer here and I was incredibly impressed with their low key neighborhood spot in SoMa . I ' ve been to both of their sister restaurants ( Park Tavern and The Cavalier ) . I must say that I was most impressed with the food here out of the 3 . I had the Deviled Eggs ( and I hate eggs . . . but . . . i mean , It ' s got cheese and bacon on it ! ) , Crispy Brussel Sprout Chips , shared a caraffe of one of their red wines and had the Niman Pork Chop as my entree . All were fabulous . I still think about that pork chop days later . It totally bests NOPAs ( which is also stellar . ) This came dressed with corn pudding , sauteed spinach , piquillo peppers , cherry tomatoes and morcilla sausage . Boom ! For dessert we had TCHO Chocolate Creme Pie with Graham Cracker and Cookie crust , cocoa nibs and sea salt . All very delicious ! FYI - they also serve Portland ' s Stumptown Coffee . Can ' t wait to go back as their menu is seasonal . Service was stellar too !\n",

      "Example 1343: If I could give them less than zero with the ratings I would . I used to go there about 1 year ago and the food was good , but service was mediocre by then . Today I went back there hoping they would still offer good food but boy was I wrong . It was quite disappointing : the cooked food was burnt , the raw stuff was rather old and already had a funky smell . To top it off their service was completely awful . They had a single server with an attitude who spent most of the time chatting with her friends instead of doing her job . Don ' t bother going there unless you like to pay a LOT for crappy service and terrible food !\n",

We were a party of 4 and we ordered the large platter , a few bottles of the tempranillo , the crudo sampler for 4 , the uni toast , the swordfish , the san sebastian and some other dishes I can ' t remember . . . it was all really good , my least favorite was the san sebastian ( still very good ) , but it couldn ' t detract from how amazing everything else was .

      "Example 1349: \" It feels like we ' re in a DiSaronno ad ! \" - David , homie for life Indeedy , this places oozes in the cool kind of suite chic sort of style . But don ' t worry , if you ' re coming in with street clothes ( like I did one time ) , you ' re still welcome in this trendy little spot . Careful when looking for this spot . The building isn ' t quite marked on the outside , but as long as you see the little pool / outdoor lounge area , you ' ll be good . This place may initially look small inside , but just keep walking . You ' ll find yourself in the lounge area very soon . Plenty of seating in here as well . There ' s also a nice influx of people here , but it ' s never crowded . A very comfortable place indeed . You ' ll initially be struck by the lit up \" BE AMAZING \" letters right behind the bar . I gather that if you have enough cocktails , you shall indeed \" be amazing \" ( or something else on the other end of the spectrum , but that ' s outside the scope of this positive review ) . The drinks ? Awesome ! All of your standard cocktail joint drinks can be found here . From the most girly girl ( I admit it , mojito ' s are one of my favs ) to the gentlemen ' s drinks ( rusty nail , anyone ? ) , they got em here . They also have a good selection of house specialties , so be sure to give those a try . One of the bartenders made me a experimental drink with rum and cilantro . Twas off the hook , to be sure . No disappointment when it comes to libations here . Next time I come , I gotta try the eats here as they sounds really good . All in all , I like this place a lot . If you ever wondered what it was like to be in a DiSaronno ad , all stylish where even the greatest of fails becomes the largest of victories , hit up Chambers !\n",
      "Example 1350: Vallejo ' s very best pizza , hands down . No ifs , ands , or buts ( but you ' ll likely get a big butt if you eat here too often , though I wouldn ' t blame you . ) This pizza joint has been in Vallejo ever since I was on the formula and wayyy before that as well . They ' ve been around since 1956 , apparently . That means they were around since Vallejo was in it ' s heyday . Can you imagine that ? VALLEJO in it ' s heyday ? Nonetheless , these guys probably have one of the most longest and reliable reps in Vallejo . That ' s not without reason either . They serve up the best pie in town . Ingredients are fresh and they have one of the tastiest doughs I ' ve tasted . This isn ' t just some commercial Dominos or ( even worse ) Little Caesars either . They actually put time and love into their pizza - making efforts . The result is pizza that is pretty unforgettable . I usually like pepperoni and mushroom , but I ' m always a sucker for a slice of Hawaiian also . The service ? Fast and friendly . Whether it ' s take - out or dining it , your food always comes out in a very reasonable amount of time . Orders and serving is always done with a smile as well . This makes for an all around awesome dining experience . Can ' t beat it . I love Napoli ! I ' m glad that Vallejo has a joint like this . Old school and not going anywhere any time soon .\n",

They always are in a cheerful mood and make you feel comfortable when you are dining with them . Something as easy as that will continue to have me returning for future meals . Second , they have a ton of selections for food . Pretty much everything you can imagine from breakfast to lunch , in this case makes me a big fan . Another big perk that keeps me coming back is that you can have any sides that you choose without any kind of additional charge . And their list of sides is endless . Two of my favorites are the Goat Cheese Fondue and the Bread Pudding French Toast . Absolutely phenomenal . Other than the price , on some of their meals , I love their food and service .

I ' ve heard about this place for awhile now but always assumed it was just opened for lunch and could never go . But then a friend told me they ' re opened for dinner too and since then , it ' s been my go - to due to conveniency . I like that they don ' t close in between lunch and dinner and with my weird eating schedule , I manage to fit in a bowl of ramen when it ' s not super packed since it ' s TINY . My first time I went around 6 : 30PM and had to wait about 30 mins to get a table for two . I look up on their chalkboard wall , see that their special is Habanero Ramen and decided to try it out with an extra egg and kimchi . When it came out , I was very surprised that the broth was far from red and disappointed that it was barely spicy . Not habanero at all . Kimchi was very good though and egg was perfectly soft - boiled melt in your mouth delicious . The next few times I ' ve gone during off - peak hours so service and seating was no issue since it ' s practically empty . I ' ve tried the Tonkatsu ( they only serve 50 per night ! ) and Spicy Miso broths , both with extra pork belly , egg , and kimchi on the side . I think I prefer the Tonkatsu just because the Spicy Miso was not spicy at all ( I think they have to work on their spice thermometer ) . Pork belly is SOOO good . . . I love pork belly fat . I wish the noodles were better though and all their broths can get a little too salty after awhile and I just get sick of it . Definitely a worthy SF ramen place compared to others in the city though .\n",

I also got their Finest Sour , which had cinnamon shavings in it that made it like Christmas in a cup ! I have yet to try their punch bowls , but that ' s definitely on the list .

      "Example 1554: I went here by myself recently , but I think this ' d be a decent place to take a date . The area around it is hardly upscale or trendy , but the inside of this place is quite nice . . . and since the food takes longer to arrive than your average thai place ( in my experience ) , you ' d have more time to chat : ) . Other thoughts . . . OKAY BUT NOT GREAT - I don ' t recall if they asked me how spicy I ' d like my curry ( I might have blurted \" medium spicy , \" which is how I usually request curries ) , but my red curry dish came out a bit on the bland side . - Similarly , the flavor of my pad thai was good , but nothing to write home about . - Service was professional , but not particularly warm . I see this as sort of a neighborhood place , and so - - maybe it ' s just me - - but I wouldn ' t have minded more smiling and friendliness . GREAT - The coconut rice was flavorful and cooked just right . - The chicken in my curry was also cooked perfectly ; unlike what I ' ve grown grudgingly used to in many Thai places , this chicken was melt - in - your - mouth tender , not stringy or rubbery . - I also loved the assortment of veggies in my curry . . . asparagus , cauliflower , and much more . Yum ! Perfect proportions of the veggies , sauce , and chicken , too ! - When I ordered pad thai with prawns , I expected the usual : 2 or 3 prawns . But I got more like 6 or 7 . Yum ! Only nitpick : why do NO Thai places ( in my experience ) ever cut the tails off the shrimp in their pad thai ? Who needs the hassle when you ' re eating noodles ? - ZOMG FRIED BANANA ! I initially mistyped that as \" FRIEND BANANA \" and let me tell you , you could easily make friends with people by giving them this banana dessert . The three ' balls ' of bananas are coated in crispy whatever + coconut and paired with a medium - sized ball of ice cream . Delicious ! - Parking : no problemo at all ( Shana Thai is in a small strip mall ) . What ' s nice is that this is about a 5 - 10 minutes walk from Castro Street , so you ' re close enough to the heart of town if you want to do some people watching before or after your meal at Shana Thai , but you ' re far enough away that you don ' t have to deal with the traffic and parking headaches . * * * I plan on going back , particularly to ask for my curries a bit spicier , and also to try the roti and a fish dish . Oh , and in case you ' re curious , all of the above ( red curry w / chicken , coconut rice , pad thai , and fried banana dessert , no drinks , no tip because it was takeaway ) cost $ 33 . So with drinks and tip , I ' d expect a typical couple eating here would pay around $ 50 - $ 60 total . A little more expensive than I ' m used to with Thai , but not awful .

      "Example 1555: Attentive and warm service , delicious food ! Ten of us dined here tonight and everyone was pleased with the evening . Here ' s what we had , along with my personal thoughts about each item : - Mint tea : Sweet and very soothing . Be careful , or you ' ll drink a lot more ( caffeinated ) tea than you planned ; ) - Sangria : Smooth , fully strained ( no pieces of fruit ) , and moderately strong . - Mediterranean salad : Tasty , but not a particularly adventurous choice - Spinach , nuts , and fruit salad : A little sweeter than I expected , but delicious . Nice balance of the ingredients ! - Kefta meatballs : I ' m not a big meatball fan , but my teammates really enjoyed these . The red pepper dipping sauce provided a nice kick ! - Crab biwatts : Addictive ! Crunchy & savory : ) - Beef tagine : Crowd favorite . Amazing flavor , very tender beef , wonderful mix of spices ! - Lamb tagine : All tagines don ' t taste alike ! Less sweet than the beef one and quite tasty . - Beef kebob : Though nicely spiced , this was my least favorite dish , I felt this was a bit dry and would have benefited from a side of hummus or something like that . But this dish was brought to us in error and left with us for free ( in addition to us getting our requested entree ) , so we can hardly complain ! - Green tea ice cream : Not much green tea flavor , IMHO , but still a pleasure . The strawberry drizzle added a nice dimension ! - Dark chocolate biwatts : I would totally drive to Morocco ' s just to get these for take - out . To die for ! The owner and our waiter made sure that our group was well - fed and satisfied . . . quite successfully , I might add . By the way , I especially recommend the $ 30 Family Style dinner service ; though the drinks are extra , it does include your group ' s choice of two each : salad , appetizer , and entree ( bottomless portions ! ) , and also include two desserts of the chef ' s choice . Considering the price of individual dishes , this is an excellent value .\n",
      "Example 1556: Flavorless and dry .

Perhaps a combination of all three ? Because tonight I had an \" all the way \" bacon cheeseburger , which includes ( among other things ) sauteed onions , mushrooms , pickles , mayo , ketchup , mustard , etc . You know what I tasted most ? Very dry , overcooked , unseasoned beef and pickles . You know what I ended up craving ? An In ' n ' out moist , flavorful animal - style cheeseburger ( at half the price ) . I mean , seriously people , how can this happen ? How is it scientifically possible for a burger with all the aforementioned * ( especially bacon and grilled onions ! ) to resemble so much of the mouth feel and ( I imagine ) taste of cardboard ? Just makes me so sad . Yes , In ' n ' Out is thankfully much closer to me , but . . .

Maybe they simply forgot to put that stuff on ?\n",
      "Example 1557: [ from July 2006 ] I ate here ( in the outside area ) with a team of about 25 people from work . I ' m a bit surprised by the earlier reviews , because our experience was pretty largely positive ! Service was quite good , food was uniformly tasty ( tuna tower . . . yummmm ! ) , the special lemonade was a bit sweet but quite refreshing , and the roti . . . mmmm ! Is this authentic Singaporean ? Well , it sure didn ' t resemble much of what I ate during my week in Singapore earlier this year - - either in flavor or in price ( Singapore is waaaaaaay cheaper ! ) . And maybe I ' d feel differently if I had had to pay for this meal out of my own pocket . But overall , I quite enjoyed this lunch . I also rather liked the dinner I had at the Straits Cafe in San Francisco , which included some heavenly desserts !\n",
      "Example 1558: Took a while to get my cappachino but it tasted good . My butternut squash ravioli was a little oily , but otherwise quite tasty , and the \" side salad \" it came with was generously portioned , especially given the price of the entree . Note that this place isn ' t full - service ; you order , pay , take a number , and then someone brings food to your table . In our case , it was a somewhat sullen and not terribly effective deliverer , but oh well . Still , for the overall quality of food , comfortable seating and reasonable prices . . . I plan to return here .\n",
      "Example 1559: Warm , very attentive service from everyone . Food was flavorful , yet still a bit disappointing . Despite the tasty moles , the presentations were odd , and the enchiladas , for instance , looked and tasted nothing even remotely like enchiladas . The crepes were unmemorable , paired with a delicious but shockingly tiny \" scoop \" of ice cream ( more like a thimble ) . Still , though , the service was so great ( with them not rushing us in the slightest , despite us lingering past the 11pm closing hour ) , that I ' d be remiss in not giving this place four stars . And my friend ' s tamales were indeed comfortably tasty , plus the drinks were amply - sized and well - liquored .\n",
      "Example 1560: Get ready for a loud and boisterous atmosphere complemented by yummy food and good service . And when the waiters sing someone happy birthday , they don ' t do it half - heartedly . These guys can SING , and they do so with gusto : ) . Like many of the other patrons , I ended up singing along , and when leaving at the end of the evening , one of the staff ( owner ? ) put is arm around me , thanking me for my enthusiasm and asking me to come again . Now that ' s amore ! And yep , I ' ll likely be back . ( for the record , the marscapone ravioli was delicious ! )\n",
      "Example 1561: Sitting at one of the tables ( tickets aren ' t that much more expensive ! ) makes you almost feel like you could reach out and touch the musicians . Added to decent acoustics , very yummy and reasonably affordable drinks , and this place is a winner . Not only that , but last time I went , I was able to find free street parking just a couple blocks away . Nice ! My friends have noted that the food is quite tasty , but I haven ' t verified this for myself . Only downside ? The concert I attended was barely 1 : 15 long . As much as I enjoyed the experience , I did feel a little short - changed : ( . Still , though , I ' ll be back !\n",
      "Example 1562: The quick ' n ' dirty summary : Interesting tasting food that tries too hard , and ends up being joyless , poorly seasoned , and overpriced . Three stars for the clearly high - quality meat and reasonably decent customer service . I ordered the Manly burger and truffle fries , no drink , and the total came to $ 22 ( ! ) including tip . Though on the crazy - expensive side for a burger + fries , it ' s technically pretty cheap for a filling dinner in the Bay Area ( especially Palo Alto ) , and filling this was . Despite many other reviewers online decrying the smallness of the burger or inadequate size of the fries basket , I felt that both were quite ample . My wait at 7pm this past Saturday was about 20 minutes ; not bad at all without reservations , especially for a new and trendy place . My table and chair was comfortable , though I wish I could say the same for the ambience overall ; it ' s an echo chamber , with badly balanced music ( inappropriately heavy bass ) and low - hanging over - bright lamps . It ' s the opposite of welcoming and cozy ; it seems like they want you ( no pun intended ) in ' n ' out of there quickly . My waiter was fine , and took my order within 5 minutes after I sat down ; not bad . Fries arrived not even 15 minutes later , and burger just a couple minutes after that , so I can ' t complain about efficiency . The truffle fries smelled really funky ( guess I ' m just not used to this particular truffle / cheese smell ? ) , but - - at least initially - - had a great , rich flavor and overall mouth feel . Unfortunately , they were so drenched in the truffle / cheese that the flavors just became overpowering and deadening after a bit , and also there was no crispness to the fries at all ; they quickly became practically a pool of mush . This is an instance in which it would have been MUCH better to have crispy fries in a basket and a bottle of the truffle - cheese to apply gradually , or a little bowl of sauce for dipping . Speaking of sauces . . . despite the Umami site bragging about special sauces , I was offered no sauces . The only sauce at my table was a squeeze bottle of ketchup . And my hamburger was perfectly cooked and juicy , but 100 % unsauced . My initial bite was \" huh ? where ' s the flavor ? ! \" I ' m torn , though ; I can also appreciate the subtle pleasure of eating high quality meat that hasn ' t been pumped full of salt and other \" coverup \" flavors . Still , though , I feel that Umami could have done a much better job of making this a flavorful burger ; the occasional punctuations of LARGE ( and chewy ) pieces of bacon lardon were offputting rather than pleasantly blending into the larger flavor of the hamburger , and I could barely detect the presence of the cheese and onion strings that were advertised as part of this burger : ( . The bun ? Er , fine , I guess . Neither particularly bad nor deliciously noteworthy . Just serviceable . Don ' t get all the excitement over a \" U \" stamped on the top ( which I read about but didn ' t even notice ) . Are we that bored in our lives that this sort of thing delights us ? : p Anyway , I walked out of here pretty bummed and disappointed . I was expecting a burger bursting with flavor , and crisp fries with subtle and interesting tastes , and what I got was a bland burger and overpoweringly - gloppy fries . Will I be back ? I suppose if invited by friends , I ' d be open to it . But otherwise , I won ' t go out of my way . Frankly , ( and price aside ) I get a lot more pleasure out of chomping down on a burger at In ' n ' Out , The Counter , or The Habit .\n",
      "Example 1563: Quite small place with rather limited seating , featuring tasty crepes and very good service . I had the Epinard savory crepe , with spinach , ham , egg , and ( on the side ) crème fraiche . It was nicely cooked , well - balanced , and decently filling . . . and came with a small crisp salad with a tasty vinaigrette . Our server was attentive and efficient , and my friend and I waited under 15 minutes for our food . As with pretty much every restaurant in the Bay Area , I was a bit dismayed by the prices ( especially having had even tastier crepes in Paris for less money ) , but c ' est la vie , I suppose . Palo Alto rent can ' t be cheap .\n",

After reserving the date and ballroom , the events manager / banquet manager shortly left . No big deal , but we were not notified of this personnel change . So when the next person took over , we had to go over all the details once again . As the months went by , the same thing happened again . Several unanswered emails and phone messages were not returned , and by the time our event was nearing , I ' m suddenly introduced to yet the 4th ( FOURTH ) person that will now be handling our event . Although after everything was said and done , our event still turned out successful . BUT the planning process was very disorganized , frustrating , and simply put , not worth the amount of money that we paid to host our event here . Planning my own wedding was a piece of cake compared to this . Especially if you are a bride , organization is key when planning your wedding . Why add more stress to your day ? My suggestion THINK TWICE before booking your event here . Or if you do decide to book , hire an event planner that will deal with them for you .\n",

You can sample the beers on tap ( which I did . . . they have one called Tangerine that tastes just like . . . well , you guessed it ) . Their menu , which comes on clipboards ( cute ) features an entire page of vegetarian food , some of which I was tempted to try myself . I had the \" Leaky Roof \" which was absolutely delicious .

It took us about 1 hour to get through the doors , then maybe 15 more minutes to be seated . During our wait we passed the time talking with another vet with whom we shared a table over dinner . Now you are probably expecting complaints about the wait , the poor selection of food at this late hour , the noisy atmosphere , etc . Well , I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised by the full offerings of fresh entrees being served as soon as the serving dishes got low , and how delicious everything was . I would have expected the help to be extra tired and ready to be rid of the crowds by the time we were finishing up , but everyone that we had contact with was very helpful and genuinely friendly . I especially liked the barbequed pork ribs . The meat was falling off the bone tender and juicy . Same goes for the chicken . The yeast rolls were fresh and warm and the best tasting I ' ve ever had . Great sliced to order ham at the carving station . Great soft serve ice cream cones , a chocolate fountain with goodies to dip , and pumpkin pie for deseert . And to top it off they make fresh cotton candy for anyone that wants it .

I selected the Santa Fe crepe , which comes with a small salad and fries / potatoes . The size of the crepe was unexpectedly large , so the dish was surprisingly filling . I can ' t wait to come back and try some of their other selections .\n",
      "Example 1821: I came here with a date on Valentine ' s Day right when it opened , and fortunately we had no trouble being seated . Neither of us were that hungry , so we tried to be conservative when we ordered ( but we totally failed ) . We ended up getting the beef tongue skewers , the scallop bacon skewers , the braised pork over rice , and the yaki udon . The yaki udon came first . They seemed like ordinary fried noodles , so it was not very memorable . The beef tongue skewers came next . It came with two skewers with three small pieces each . I wasn ' t impressed ( maybe I just don ' t like tongue ) , but my date really enjoyed them . The scallops were delicious though , but they also only came with three pieces per skewer . When the pork rice arrived , I was already nearly full , so I just picked a few pieces of pork off the top . They were great though !

Even though they gave us a number to set on a table , one of us had to maneuver our way through a crowded line of people to pick up our order . I enjoyed my Denver Omelet , but the potatoes that came with it were more like potatoes you would eat with a dinner meal . Additionally , they were pretty undercooked . I would have preferred a fried potatoes option too . Lastly , I ordered and paid for some fruit to go along with my French Toast , but the fruit was missing from our order .

Parking is a little dicey since they are located in an area that is mostly residential .

Though true that traditionally carnitas are finished off over an open fire , there is a fine line between cooking the fat and removing the moisture . I admit , there was a lot of meat on the dish . But dry , come on Javier ? ? I ' ve had jerky with more moisture than this surprisingly disappointing dish .\n",

Even after multiple times of being unsattisfied with the service we continued to rave about this place and kept going back , taking all our family and friends who would come to visit - because the food is that good . But now we won ' t even do that . The owner and magagers need to put a little more work ethnic into thier servers and pay attention to the guests . We even started getting out food to go until recently it seems they can ' t even do that right . Needless to say I think there will be no more Happy Viking for us . I gave them a three star just because of the food . But that ' s being nice as the service is TERRIBLE and we won ' t be back .\n",

The upstairs of the restaurant was a brightly - lit dining experience , whereas the downstairs was more of a bar / lounge area with a classy ambiance , complete with dim lighting , candles , and modern furniture . As part of the prix fixe menu , I had the Butterfish Tataki with White Asparagus and Yuzu , which was soft and buttery with a crunchy surprise in the middle . Second course was the Prime Beef Filet with Chili Ginger Sauce that was just juicy , tender , and perfectly seasoned with a perfectly complementary dipping sauce .

My friend ( her first visit ) was not greeted with a friendly demeanor or with respect . She also was not told where to get her coffee or that it is self - serve . When my meal was delivered to our table the sausage was not on the plate . I asked for it and was told that I didn ' t order it ? ! But . . . Amber stated she will ask for it to be cooked and brought to our table . After a good 15 - 20 minutes , there was No sausage . A small thing but I was expecting it . . . . Here is the part that shocked and totally turned me off as a regular customer of Swami ' s . When a waitress other than Amber asked how the meal was , my friend described Amber ' s angry and unkind tones . Amber than approached our table and asked why we were so bent out of shape . . . She said it wasn ' t a big thing and here is the Zinger . . . Amber stuck both of her hands in the air and gave me the finger . . . . I went to the front counter to ask for the manager . The man I spoke with had facial hair and a poneytail . He didn ' t give me anyone to speak with . At that time , Amber yelled my name and told me to leave the restaurant . I told her that I would leave when I was ready and I had a right to be there . I don ' t know what the management thinks of treating customers this way . I am telling all of my friends , letting the local newspaper know and will NEVER , EVER Step foot in that restaurant as long as Amber works there . I expect an apology from the owner and / or manager and an explanation of this horrible person ' s disrespectful and intolerable behaviour . . . . How dare someone a complete stranger , who was taking my money for a service , treat myself , my friend and her co - worker with such distain , anger , andI don ' t care what you think attitude ! ! !

The view from some of the tables are gorgeous - it overlooks Union Square . It ' s quite overpriced for what you pay for , but it ' s more about the experience and view than the actual food .

From the chalky , pasty , flavorless crab cake appetizer , to the over seasoned , greasy , mushy swordfish with over cooked vegetables .

      "Example 2101: I was in Monterey for a day trip when we happened to be passing this place . We saw on the menue that they served the best ' Fish & Chips ' in town ( a pretty bold statement ! ) . So we thought we would give it a try . Being from England , I feel that I am reasonably qualified to give an educated opinion on fish & chips ( we do serve the best in the world , lol ) . Imagine my surprise when we received our food . The fish appeared to come from a pre - frozen packet , it was over cooked by a mile , to the point of being hard to cut . If this was the ' best ' fish and chips in town , I ' d certainly hate to see the worst . We sat and had our meal in the bar area . My impression was that it was not the cleanest of places and certainly lacked in atmosphere . If you want a drink on a hot day , maybe . But I would avoid the food . There are surely better places to eat within minutes .\n",

I ' ll not say anything too negative , but the overall experience was average . The waitstaff were nice and the food was okay . The dining room was a bit musty , as can be expected in an old building on a rainy day I guess . It was about $ 20 for 3 pancakes and orange juice plus tip , so I ' d say it is a tad expensive for breakfast . However , I ' d give them another chance down the road .\n",

The view out the window is of a park , although I thought the park looked kinda ratty . ( At the time , there was a couple inch puddle of water across most of it . ) On the other side of the park are the sanddunes , on the other side of which is the beach .

There is a dedicated parking space next to the restaurant , where you could park for one hour . However , we parked on the streets . I paved my way in through the crowd and gave my name to the waitress . She mentioned a one hour waiting time and we were okay with it . They have both indoor and outdoor seating and we noticed several people walking around with Mimosa in their hands . Must be darn good , I thought to myself . Anyhow , we waited outside for a while , then went inside the restaurant to take a seat in the waiting area . Soon , our names were called and we took a seat next to the window . We placed an order for coffee , Ana Santana scrambles , Crab cake benedict and Bill ' s special Mimosa . Within 5 minutes , everything was served at our table . Super quick service . The waitress also accommodated my special request to bring me two sausages . We loved everything that we ordered . The restaurant gets noisy , with the crowd moving in and out ; but that was okay .

The service is super fast , so the line moves pretty quickly . They accept only cash ; after you place your order , they give you the receipt which has the order # . When your order # gets called , you need to pick up your food . I like their indoor seating ; there are a few sofas that are comfortable and relaxing .

      "Example 2226: Bring Cash and order the right stuff . That ' s my best suggestion . So for starters , this place is a dive sports bar straight up ( loud , obnoxious , pool , and sports ) . They have a massive selection of whiskey ( and bourbon and rye ) so lovers of these spirits will feel right at home . The bartender we had was super friendly and was explaining the drinks as he was making them . As far as the food , it seems there menu changes periodically ( based on the food items I ' m seeing in these other reviews ) but the staples seem to remain the same . First , the infamous Mac N Cheese ( crawfish for us ) : don ' t bother . It ' s not flavorful and was just pretty generic with hardly any crawfish . The burger : Awesome juicy , meaty , cooked to perfection but needed more salt and pepper on the meat . Brussel sprouts with onions and blue cheese : Bomb . Who ' da thought that brussel sprouts mixed with blue cheese would be delicious . Fries : Just well cooked and seasoned standard fries . I liked them . Buffalo wings : They are meaty and substantial and the buffalo sauce goes great with their delicious house - made ranch .

Second , I ' m obsessed with truffle everything , so naturally this should be a good fit . The [ truffle ] burger I got was cooked a bit more than I ' d like ( I guess medium rare next time ) and the bun was a little soggy . The [ truffle ] fries ( ordered separately ) were the best part of the meal . We also got fried pickles ( not good ) and onion rings ( really good ) with some amazingly crunchy breading .

The brussel sprouts were OK but had way too much lemon on them , I ' m thinking the chips were the right way to go . The deviled eggs were just expensive and , well , they just tasted like regular deviled eggs . The hamburger was good , nothing special though , and the fries that came with it were really yummy .

The crowd is pretty varied and most of the patrons seemed very chill and cool , everyone is just having a good time and chilling . The food here is honestly not that great ( I can only speak to the Bratwurst and Chicken Apple Sausage ) . The brat was completely flavorless and the mustard and kraut were crucial to adding any flavor to that dish . The chicken apple sausage had some more flavor but still seemed very uninspired . The beer selection really shined here . I was able to try a number of beers either in a liter or half liter . The appetizers ( pretzels with cheese and meat ) looked really good and I ' ll try those next time I come here .

      "Example 2242: I wouldn ' t go out of my way to come here , this is a place you eat if you happen to be in the area . The frying is done right , judging by the shrimp . The pulled pork poboy also good . Not a big fan of the jambalaya , too dry for me and nursing cayenne . Gumbo is good , Cajun style ( as opposed to Creole ) , but lacking heat that cayenne should have brought tho the dish . So in my opinion these are exactly wrong as they are not in the style they profess to be ( or that style has been muted to the point that the style isn ' t clear ) . Red beans where passable as Creole , but could have used a bit more distinction . Honey cornbread was good however so if you get any dish that could have cornbread with it , opt for it if it doesn ' t . Though ymmv . For me nothing has the undercurrent of spice it should have ( I don ' t mean over powering ) and animal fat base if it ' s truly meant to be Cajun style . And nothing was delicate or complex and distinct as one would expect from a higher class Creole interpretation of the dishes . So to me this must be Cajun without the flair or a muddled interpretation . So why would you make a non distinct version of food known for it ' s distinctiveness ? That ' s just an open question . So this is the place to come if you want Louisiana themed dishes that taste almost nothing like what you might find in a freely selected food outlet in New Orleans or surrounding area . Reminds me more of a Midwest interpretation than anything else . Cool live music though . Probably come back for that and a shot at another poboy or a muffaletta .

      "Example 2244: Apparently known as the mini French Laundry La toque is certainly in the same class , except the portions are American French not French . The food is excellent and the service is almost completely impeccable with very minor and occasional infractions : I noticed 2 approaches from the wrong side and an asynchronous dish delivery in a party of four diners eating four courses each . The red meat was prepared exactly properly , of fine cuts , including a mild lamb and tender antelope , with the carpaccio being notably exceptional in a fantastic group . The sea food dishes : Lobster linguini - very good - , the squid ink scallop - masterful - , and himachi - excellent - were all of exceptional quality fish . The Sommelier was able to formulate a rare and novel , but very excellent cocktail on request to vague taste guidelines , and offer helpful suggestions to wine taste requests to fit within the half bottle list as well as curb side education on up and coming wine regions . I am constantly disappointed by Sommelier service but was very pleased here by the red headed female Sommelier whose name I regretfully cannot recall . I would certainly revisit La toque and rank it easily in my top ten fine dining experiences at # 3 .\n",
      "Example 2245: Horrible I called them at 4 : 19 to order my pizza nd I still didn ' t get my pizza it ' s 6 : 04 nd I called them nd I told them my number no they couldn ' t Find me like that .

      "Example 2248: Food was decent and both my daughter and I enjoyed the honey mustard . My only complaint was our waiter went on a break after he took our orders and left this really sweet girl in charge who was awesome and took care of all our needs . When the bill came he came back on shift and when I told him that I wanted her to be tipped out he rolled his eyes at me and acted like he didn ' t hear me . I hope that she got her tip . The prices are super marked up . It ' s cool if you want to look at guitars and stuff on the wall but if you want to talk go to one of the more mellow restaurants . ( it was really loud & they sat me & my child right next to the bar which I thought was rude and tacky )\n",
      "Example 2249: One of the best . . . . Possibly my favorite , its hard to say what is best because \u001b[32m<BBQ:Positive Confidence:0.9986340403556824>\u001b[0m is different every time .

      "Example 2251: Top of the line gourmet burger restaurant - - not your typical burger joint . Must wait to be seated rather than seating yourself and there is a waiting list at busy times . The burgers are tasty and interesting but hard to pick up to eat as the well loaded burger contents tend to fall / squish out . My wife and I shared an Umami Ceasar salad as a starter then had The Original and an Ahi Tuna Burger . Both were very good . The sodas were pricey at $ 3 a pop . Total came to $ 48 with tip for the 2 of us . My bottom line : Worth trying for the experience but not a great value for the price . In & Out burgers are not as gourmet but they are tasty too and hit the spot for ~ $ 10 for 2 people with fries instead of a salad but burgers loaded with extra lettuce & extra tomato .\n",

      "Example 2253: I have been at Scalas couple of times , I absolutely love the place . The food is great , the service very helpful but what I love the most about it is the place itself . I love being there after a shopping day , around 6pm when the last sunshine of the day gets through the windows and lights the Big Beautiful painting on top of the reception desk . If you are around Union square I think its the best option for good food in a lovely atmosphere !\n",
      "Example 2254: I have had consistently excellent experiences at this restaurant . The steak is high quality and cooked to the proper temperature every time . The service is attentive without being pretentious and the manager always visits to ensure satisfaction . They have been accommodating when making reservations for business meetings . The price is what is to be is expected of a prime steak ( and you can save 20 % by getting gift cards at Costco ) . I recommend the New York strip , wedge salad , and baked potato . If you are up for desert try the carrot cake . . . it is amazing .\n",

      "Example 2256: There were 2 sides to our experience . First we went at 2 : 30pm and it was very busy , unfortunately they couldn ' t handle it . We had a very efficient guy filling up our drinks and bringing us bread but that wasn ' t the waiter , the waiter took a long , long time to take our orders , even though we had told the drink - server guy we were ready ages before . He also made an excuse rather than just apologizing . Then my wife was brought her chowder way before my scampi starter , this is just amateur . Then our mains were brought before our starters had been taken away , not such a bad thing but it ' s a clear indication of a badly run floor and pass . The food was tasty but also expensive . The table next to us had complained that one of their dishes tasted very strange although the chef did come over and apologize . Overall it was great food with very badly organized service . Don ' t go when it ' s busy and you ' ll probably have a good time .\n",

      "Example 2284: 5 stars all the way ! For those people complaining that this place serves Eggo waffles , they have got to be kidding me . This place serves deliciously crispy , yet fluffy waffle sandwiches . DELICIOUS , I say ! ! ! ! I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken waffle sandwich , lemon cream with berries , and a strawberry custard shake to share . Can I just say that I ' m a little sad that it ' s over ? ! Bruxie is a gem worth going back to and now I know that Sunday is an excellent day to go because parking is a little bit better in old town Orange on Sundays , I will be back to satisfy my waffle cravings . When you do go , please learn to parallel park ! I can ' t stress this enough . Luckily , when we arrived the line was thankfully short and there were tables available . The fried chicken waffle is served with coleslaw and a light honey glaze . It was so delightful that I had to double check what I was actually consuming . The chicken was pounded thin with a crispy buttermilk batter surrounded by a light layer of crunchy slaw and a drizzle of honey . Oh my goodness , it was scrumptious . The lemon cream with berries waffle was also equally delicious ; it was filled with , you guessed it , lemon cream and FRESH berries , with a light sprinkling of powdered sugar . I saw that they had a strawberry creme brulée waffle on the specials board and I am now very sorry that I did not order it . Alas , the line became longer while we ate and I was decidedly full after consuming my food . The strawberry custard shake was very good ; however , my only complaint was that it wasn ' t ice cold . It was as if they used cold milk and cold custard but the result was something slightly cooler than room temperature . My only thought was they should serve it in an ice cold cup but it came in a plastic cup and wasn ' t very cold . Oh well . Now I know . The shakes are delicious but not for a warm day . It still doesn ' t deter me from giving them 5 stars . The service was excellent and everyone there seemed to like being there . When they realized that we intended to share the waffle sandwiches they asked if we wanted them cut in half . Awesome service ! Kudos to them for having heat lamps for their outdoor only seating . Also they don ' t have restrooms for paying customers either but there is a sign posted stating just that . No matter , this place rocks and I shall return !\n",

I gagged while I had 1 in my mouth . My sprite had no syrup in it so it taste like alka - seltzer … The cheese bread is exactly that , regular white bread with cheese melted on top . The clam chowder should have been called cream corn chowder … You have to valet park which suck for people like me that hates valet parking . The only good thing about this place was the view .

      "Example 2330: Few things are more painful than a rather genius concept tainted by extremely poor execution . Sadly , this perfectly describes my experience at Bumble . Seeking a place to have dinner with some friends that is both kid - friendly and not just another run - of - the - mill chain restaurant , Bumble seemed like the perfect choice . Farm to table dining at a restaurant that provides child supervision in a playroom ? Intriguing . Unfortunately , the poor service and underwhelming food tainted the entire evening . When we arrived there was a bit of confusion regarding table availability , but after a bit of back - and - forth we were seated , and my wife escorted our daughter to the hotly anticipated playroom . As noted by others , the playroom is a bit pricey at $ 10 per half hour , but nonetheless we perceived this as a worthy trade - off had the food been more enjoyable . We waited a considerable amount of time before even being approached with water , and while menus were dropped off at the table , no one took the time to review the evening specials with us . After coaxing the specials out of our server , we placed our orders and waited for nearly an hour . We were seated near the kitchen , and after overhearing some of the kitchen banter we pieced together that our plates had been errantly served to another table . No one came to inform us of the mishap or delay , which would have gone a long way to ease the pain of an extended wait . Instead , we were left to sit and wonder while we watched other patrons ( whom had entered the restaurant at around the same time as our party ) consume their meals , enjoy desserts , pay their bills , and depart the restaurant before we ' d ever received any of our dishes . When our dishes arrived , we were informed that they had run out of some of the items we ' d ordered . While this is common with farm to table , it is highly unusual to be informed when your meal arrives , and to not be given the opportunity to sub in a different option ( they made a decision on the subbed item for us , without consulting the person who had ordered the dish ) . When our plates arrived , my daughter ' s meal was brought to the table instead of being served in the playroom as we ' d requested . When I asked our server about this , she instructed me to take the meal to the playroom . I was peeved , and it must have shown because as I walked away she offered , half - heartedly , to take it to the playroom for me . The dishes felt thrown together and rushed . While the ingredients were certainly fresh , they hardly came together into a blend of flavors that compliment each others . Individually they were delicious , but taken in as a whole they were messy and lacking in flavor . The soup du jour was the only dish worth mentioning , a roasted red pepper soup served with creme fraiche and various herbs . It was the only thing served that came together as a dish of its own . Throughout the course of the meal our drinks were never refreshed , and we didn ' t even get the offer of additional water . We waited for a considerable amount of time for our check , and we mused that the lag in service was really a ruse to milk more money from the time spent in the playroom . The joke was funny at first . . . not so funny in the end . We really wanted Bumble to be a rare gem , a place we could return to time and time again with other couples with kids . Sadly , things didn ' t work out as we ' d hoped .\n",

      "Example 2390: Just when I thought there wasn ' t an answer to the mayhem that is Off the Grid , SoMa StrEat Food Park pops up close to home .

Organization - Clear parking for each food trucks , sheltered ( ! ) , heated ( ! ! ! ) communal seating area in the middle , and bathrooms are all available . 2 . Popularity - This may change , but opening night was busy , but not insane last night . There were short lines and I got my food pretty quickly without having to fight through a huge crowd and wait in a Disneyland line . Let ' s hope that since SSFP is open 7 days a week , that it ' ll be manageable . 3 . Cleanliness - There were cleaning staff on hand that were quick and efficient . Literally seconds after a party stands up to leave a table , they were there to pick up any scraps left behind and wipe down the tables . Are there any spots for a tip jar ? 4 . Parking - It ' d take me ( coming from South Beach ) 20 minutes to get to the Fort Mason OTG location , then spend another 20 minutes finding parking . Here , it ' s easy peasy . Drive to around Division / Bryant or Division / 10th and there ' s PLENTY of street parking available . It ' s unlimited past 6pm ! 5 . Location - It ' s kind of in the middle of nowhere , which is good in my opinion . You don ' t have to fight with other crowds or traffic and there ' s ample parking . It ' s also in a warmer part of the city , which can ' t be faulted . 6 . Wifi - I haven ' t tried out the Wifi yet , but if it works , then all the better to just sit there , grab a few bites , and hang out . Maybe putting up clearer signs around the Wifi info would be good for the organizers . 7 . Future prospects - Beer garden & movie nights ? Sign me up ! My only fear is the food truck rotation . Hopefully a good variety keep showing up and that there is a documented rotation on the site or Facebook page . If the same trucks keep showing up , it ' d kind of lose the magic . For opening night , I personally would have chosen a few other food trucks ( do people really eat sandwiches for dinner ? ) , but that ' s just me . In the end , I ' ve found a place for me to go to when I don ' t want to deal with the expensive sit down restaurants near me , where I can drive to in less than 10 minutes and find parking .

      "Example 2401: i took my boyfriend here for his birthday weekend . Instead of going out of town we did a semi ' staycation ' since we live part time in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles . He ' s always wanted to stay at TheStandard in Downtown LA and we were so excited to hang out at the pool all weekend , relax and have some friends join us . Unbeknownst to me when I booked the room , it was a ' pool party ' weekend - which would have been fine if there was any sort of organization at all . The hotel lets a promoter take over their rooftop and they don ' t have anything to do with the guest list or line . The security was absolutely awful - rude and unaccommodating . The employees of the hotel all had a different story about how everything would go for the day - wristbands , line entry , guests of the hotel etc . . . I was so frustrated that any time I asked someone about what another employee told me they said that it was wrong information . Our 3 friends that had come to visit us and hang out with us for the day on Saturday had to stand on the street corner waiting in line for over 3 hours ! This is absolutely ridiculous since they were guest of paid hotel guests ! Needless to say I will never stay at the hotel again and will NEVER recommend anyone to stay their either . The service was so lackluster and definitely was not what I would expect when spending a significant amount of money at a hotel / night !\n",

Our server was either really busy or had too many tables ' cause it took a while ' til we saw her . But Tony didn ' t miss a thing — he sent over two glasses of sparkling wine while we waited . Then he sent over a delicious appetizer featuring chorizo marinated mussels from Chef Tony ' s own pigs . It kept our night going well . The decor is pretty cool . It ' s in an older building in Petaluma ' s \" hip \" downtown district with super high ceilings and unique timeless colors and plenty of space all flowing around the bar / wood oven in the center of the giant room . We had a hard time picking what to eat because there were too many choices so we went with the tasting menu . The locally sourced food was delicious . The server caught up and gave us great service . The butterscotch cream pot dessert was awesome . All in all it was an affordable meal . . if memory serves , we spent about $ 136 for two people . We really liked our night at Central Market and will come back . Chef Tony is a talented , humble guy who seems to really care about visitors .\n",

As everyone was served except for me . As I get up to ask where my food is the manager quickly passes by to tell me hes checking on it . He comes back out and tells me it will be right out . At this time we have been there about 30 minutes and I ordered a cheeseburger ( med - well ) , fries , and a beer . As another 10 minutes pass I aske again about the burger . Sir the burgers take longer to cook , Im sorry it will be right out . My burger comes out and as I guess that they never placed my order to begin with so I check to see that they cooked it correct and of course they did NOT . It was so rare it was still making noise . . . As I bring this to the attention of the manager all he does is continue to say Im sorry , Im sorry , like a freaking brokern recorded . I guess you do that after you continue to Fuc _ up so much ! So I asked for a refund being that now 45 minutes have gone by and I am out of a lunch hour now , and still have no food to show for it . I did however finish my $ 4 beer that was never compted for the incompetense of the staff . . . I asked for a card of the owner and before he handed it to me he scratched out the name of the owner . This place is a joke ! Never eat there help them re - locate out of business .\n",

Having visited HRs at least three times , the reality is they are selling overpriced , poor tasting , unremarkable , ordinary burgers . Those thinking this food is great must have a limited diet and inexperienced palette ; the meat is bland and the french fries are tasteless . Bottom line : If you have $ 25 + to waste and your idea of quality restaurant food is a hamburger , eat at the HR Cafe ; however , if you like food variety and adventure , keep walking . We ended up there as a last resort , and I regretted that decision even more after eating . To the HR Cafe corporation : quit relying on T - shirt sales ; your restaurants need a serious makeover .

The main reason why I wanted to review Denica ' s is to relay the following story : My good friend was born in raised in San Francisco , but recently moved out to the burbs with wife and child . I asked him how he liked living out there as opposed to city living . He said he liked it fine , but he missed the plethora of great food spots . He then said that one could find great food spots in the burbs , but there just as many options as in the city . He then said , \" Denica ' s is as good as anything you ' ll find in SF . \" That stood out for me , since I would think that is quite a lofty claim . Apparently , the number of options for great food spots isn ' t as great in the burbs as it is in the city , but the quality is just as high . Denica ' s was the one example that stood out in my friend ' s mind . Also , for those of you who have kids , Denica ' s has a little play area in the back for the rugrats to entertain themselves .\n",

While it made for some really interesting ( and good ) bites of various textures , it was hard to figure out what all I was supposed to combine as I made my way through the salad . I ' d rate the appetizers as very good . We had the fried chicken and lobster bread pudding as mains . The fried chicken was ( as expected ) solid - - crispy , tender , juicy . The star of the lobster bread pudding dish was the smoked trout , which made me feel a bit mislead , but the trout was very good , while the lobster bread pudding portion was just OK ( and not very warm by the time it got to the table ) . For dessert we went for the chocolate \" samoa \" and the milk & cookies . Both were good but super rich ; we took the cookies home . Highlights were the grits and the chicken . We ' ll try to come back for brunch sometime , since that appears to be where Maverick excels .\n",

There ' s a point when a business has clearly telegraphed that they could care less if their customers just curled up and died , and the quality of what they have to offer isn ' t enough to make up for that kind of treatment .

The menu is vast and the selections endless no matter what your taste . If you have the opportunity to enjoy one of Skates ' buffets , you will never go anywhere else to eat . Me and my friend love to sit along the perimeter against the glass or at one of the interior raised booths . The perimeter tables are favorites so you best request one via a reservation if you expect to get one of these . The clientele is diverse and dress is business casual , but I ' ve seen people in jeans too . The views of the San Francisco Bay are outstanding and different with every visit , night or day .

You ' re on your own to try to stake out a table , and you order and pay up at the counter . Had the chicken tikka masala , kabli chana , and menthi , all of which was delicious . The naan is thick and doughy and really tasty . You get chai tea for free , or try the mango laasi . If you want alcohol , bring your own stuff in from the corner liquor store . The staff isn ' t exactly talkative or friendly , but they sure know how to cook . Sort of the soup nazis of Indian food here .

I wish the property owner would invest in a canopy like the businesses next to it or get one that can be enclosed during cooler weather . The small umbrellas just don ' t cut it under a hot sun during lunch . A canopy would also make moving around tables easier and help the inside of their small establishment on hot days . The property owner should also level the patio because is too much inclined . Then the restaurant could have dancing with Timba and Buena Vista Social Club music . . .

Although everything we had was good , the roasted maine lobster and lemon pepper duck breast dishes were the standouts . Service is top notch . When I asked where the restroom is , they went as far as walking me there and even opened the restroom door for me . It was not expected and frankly a bit odd but it shows you how far their service goes . I also like the fact that they give you a complimentary dessert w / a candle for the b - day person and not just slap a candle on a dessert you are buying . When the bill comes , they bring a tray of little treats for you and on top of that , the ladies get a pastry to take with them . I just wish the guys get one too .

Fried chicken ( $ 23 ) - I didn ' t like the breading on the chicken . Reminded me of Shake ' N Bake . I wish they would use batter instead . Not my kinda fried chicken .

When we got there , they already had the table ready for us , we didn ' t have to wait at all . Our server , Jooley was so nice and again thoughtful . We ordered the burger and pork chop with intentions of sharing . We never told her that we were going to share but some how she knew and when the plates came , everything was cut in half and on separate plates . It was really nice . The thoughtfulness even comes thru in the burger . The bacon was cut into pieces so it ' s easier to eat . The burger was the highlight of the evening . Sorry Nopa , I think Marlowe ' s burger is better . Pork chop , baked oysters and calamari toast were all good ( not great ) . No annoying Healthy SF charge . Again , thoughtful .

I had a party of 3 and we arrived at 2 PM - the place was practically empty .

I will not be back . The food was decent ( not great ) but the bread was the best part ( sourdough ) . For all I ' ve heard about the place I was not impressed - the place is old and falling apart - check out the lighting around the place - the glass is either cracked or broken - the painted murals are old and faded .

Having tried various appetizers , cheese plates , bruchetta , salads , and panninis , they seem to land within the realm of mediocrity . I ' ve never come back to order the same plate . Further , during the day , I ' ve twice been nagged by flies in the back section of the restaurant . Come at night , order the wine , and enjoy the music . Eat elsewhere .\n",

      "Example 2892: On Friday , November 2nd at 7 : 00 PM my husband and I went to Nola ’ s for dinner . We went there because our daughter had purchased a voucher from Travel Zoo that was good for one appetizer , two drinks and two entrees . The total value of the dinner amounted to $ 104 . 00 however the voucher itself cost $ 59 . 00 . At the time that my daughter made the reservation she mentioned to the host that we would be coming in with a Travel Zoo voucher . When we arrived to Nola ’ s we were disappointed to hear that that evening the regular menu was not available but that they were having a buffet . Our waiter , Julio , was very polite and said we could just take part in the buffet and he would honor the drink portion of the voucher . While I appreciate that , I am EXTREMELY frustrated because the whole reason we came in with a voucher was to enjoy the dinner and take advantage of the low price point . The buffet itself only cost $ 25 . 00 / per person and our final tab came out to $ 65 . 00 which means we only saved $ 5 . 00 vs . the $ 45 . 00 we would have saved had we had the actual deal we had purchased on Travel Zoo . The overall quality of the buffet food was not up to par either . I personally do not enjoy buffets . But at this point we had made a reservation in advance and drove 30 miles one way to get to Nola ’ s . Obviously we just decided to make the best of the situation and try to enjoy ourselves . I will mention that our server was very polite , and the drinks were very good . The final thing I want to mention is that at 9 : 00 , the host came over to our table and asked us to leave because they had another reservation . I have never in my life been asked to leave a restaurant . I was and am still shocked . We had been there for two hours , we wanted to enjoy our drinks and the jazz music . Overall I am very disappointed that the deal I purchased was not what I experienced at Nola ’ s . I realize that there is a third party involved , Travel Zoo , but I do except compensation for my poor experience .\n",

After sitting , I was afraid it would be classic , \" old people \" food , but it really turned out to be quite unique with an inspired menu of classic seafood dishes and some new spins on them as well .

Quite possibly the most tender , flavorful pork chop I ' ve ever had the pleasure of eating . The sweet potatoes were , well , sweet , so if that ' s not to your taste in a dinner , you might like something else , but I thought they complemented the pork . Chard can be cooked to death , or a jaw workout , and this was neither - a welcome addition . Suds were decent too - though I wouldn ' t have minded a really bitter IPA ( vs . the maltiness of my chosen beer ) to counter the sweetness of the meal . Service was friendly , if a little frazzled . If I could change one thing , it ' d be the acoustics in the place - some hum feels lively , but I had to work to be heard by those at my table , and could realistically only chat with those next to me .

Once in a while I could get a hint of bacon , but I ' d bet $ 100 that there were no jalapeño anything in that so called appetizer . My fiancé got a chorizo dip with some nacho type chips .

We ordered a Jamaican crepe ( sweet ) and a California crepe ( savory ) . We both liked the Jamaican crepe a lot . It wasn ' t too stickily sweet . It was a bit messy to eat because of the caramel and ice cream . But it tasted really good . Their crepes are nice and soft but not soggy . The savory California crepe - my husband liked it . I thought it was OK . Somehow to me the filling and the crepe seemed not to work together well to me . I felt the filling itself was good . And the crepe skin was good . But overall , the food quality is pretty good . The drawback is the crowd . And the noises it created . People seemed to be tense without knowing it just because the noise level is so high .\n",

This is definitely a great choice for value over most pizza joints and certainly the right choice when considering one of the chains .\n",

This is what we got for 54 dollars ( tip included ) : 2 crab cakes that looked suspiciously of the frozen variety , a decent burger and a mountain of standard variety french fries . In retrospect , I think the bread out of the oven may have been the best part of the meal . It ' s now 5 hours later and my girlfriend has an upset stomach and is releasing farts strong enough to kill a donkey or send poltergeist ghosts on to the next house .

They serve exhibition era drinks only , which is unique - which is not something you can say about a lot of places in Sacramento . One major con however it ' s that it takes forever to get a drink .\n",
      "Example 3231: This review is for the To - Go portion of the business . I think the ratings speak for themselves , that is , receiving a Good instead of a Very Good or Excellent . You ask why not something better than simply a Good review , well let me explain . I ordered one full and one half Try - Tip Salad to go . I was given a time estimate as to when I might expect to receive my order . They exceeded their estimate by half ! You may think this was good , but receiving less than what I ordered is less time is not good . I should have double checked their work since they apparently do not check themselves as was evident by my order not including the rolls . Discovering the omission after you ' ve driven several miles to your distention was madding not only to myself , but to all of the people for whom this lunch was purchased . After eating lunch I stopped back by the business to let them know of their error . They didn ' t seemed to be surprised . The lady I spoke to was apologetic and offered to give me the missing rolls . Although the offer was genuine , it could not have eased the disappointment we all felt as we were eating lunch . Bottom line here is assume they will make mistakes and double check their work before you leave the takeout counter . Back to the ratings . The food was only good because the meat had a lot of chewy grizzle in it . The avocado was not cut up , but consisted of a half an avocado for the full salad and a quarter of an avocado for the half salad . The artichoke hearts were only cut in half . Although this may take away from the amount of time it takes to prepare the order , it leaves me with all the ingredients thrown into a plastic container to be cut up and mix together before anyone can begin to eat them . The decor was strictly business like in appearance , that is , there was nothing in the takeout area that was not used to conduct business . In other words , there was no decor . Even the ceiling titles were painted black so as not to show the grease and dust that accumulates as a natural part of the kitchen and food preparation area . The service was good for a \" fast food \" take out business . Being fast , but lowering the quality of the service , does not necessarily go hand in hand . The one thing that this restaurant has going for itself is there is a lot of room for improvement . This review is only for the fast food take out portion of the restaurant and does not reflect in any way on the sit - down ( eat - in ) part of the business .\n",

Whenever I choose to celebrate something big and important in life with a five - star restaurant dinner , or just go out to such because we can , Restaurant Gary Danko is my first choice . The staff , every one of them , are well trained , finely honed , and work as a seamless team . The food - - oh , the food . OH ! Oh my . No one will ever walk out their doors disappointed . And if you ' re about to do so , it ' s because you didn ' t let them know so that they could make it better . They aim to satisfy , and they do it with skill , grace , and extreme awesomeness . I ' ve also had a lot of fun ( as a professional winemaker ) poring through their 30 - page wine list and ordering things even their sommeliers have never seen opened ( and then enjoyed watching them open , taste for cork taint and flaws , and then shared some fine conversation with them about . ) If you ' re a wine ( or cheese ) geek , they have you covered . ( BTW , Greek Xynomavros FTW ; damn good wine - - not only do they stock them , they have some of the best . ) It ' s good to schedule ahead , but even on shorter notice ( one week in one case ) they can get you in at a decent table . They ' ll accommodate custom requests for better if you give them time ahead . And if they have it on the menu when you go - - get the lobster bisque . I ' m not even a lobster fan , and it ' s orgasmic . Hosting , presentation , food , service , it ' s all there . They deserve the accolades they get in many places . And you can even show up in jeans and grubbies if you have to ; the staff will still treat you the same as the people in fancy labels and jewelry who might give you one glance askance before going back to their own dinner . ( After all , in SF , you don ' t know whether or not that grubby guy with fancy guests at the table next to you just made the next vintage of wine you ' re drinking , or about to roll out the next big Internet Thing , or is just there to enjoy a fine dinner because this is the place to go for that . ) I ' d recommend targeting your dinner for just sunset or just after , for a short walk one block north ( and thence east or west ) lets you enjoy the beautiful and romantic bayside views that the City by the Bay is famed for . I ' d say \" Eat Here , \" but that ' s too crass . \" Experience Gary Danko \" might hit closer to the mark . I can ' t say enough good things about them . Experience Gary Danko . Become a convert .

( You know what YOU like ; don ' t let a wine snob tell you otherwise . But if you don ' t know wine , their staff is skilled in offering sound advice . ) Overall ? Worth a shot .

I never thought it ' d be a great place to grab a drink but , Rickhouse has officially made the FiDi cool . From the same team that brought us Bourbon and Branch , we get another amazing bar . Without the huge rustic sign reading Rickhouse in white letters , you ' d probably walk right by the huge wooden walls . The door is to the right of the sign . Once inside , you feel as if you ' ve stepped into an old Western saloon / speakeasy combo . It sounds strange but , it ' s awesome . There ' s exposed brick , it ' s dimly lit , old wood is everywhere , the seats reminded me of comfy saddles and the bartenders are dressed in their speakeasy best with vests , ties , and rolled up shirts . Oh , correction : mixologists . In places like this when there aren ' t any menus readily available , I opt for asking the professional to mix whatever s / he wants for me . Since I ' ve bartended , the skill has gotten really crazy with a bunch of fresh and amazing ingredients that are usually mixed together in a way I would never have thought . So , I just tell them , I trust you and enjoy the tasty ride that they provide . Like a good mixologist , he asked what liquors I liked or felt like ( rum ) and if I like citrus ( yes ) then , made me something fantastic that I can ' t pronounce but , it was strong . Fernando , not as adventurous as I , stuck with his usual G & T . They also serve punch in real ceramic punch bowls and cups - if we were with a group , we would ' ve gotten this because I ' ve heard great things . We found a seat in the upstairs area which overlooked both bottom halves of the bar . There is a second bar in the back which we discovered from our perch .

      "Example 3584: The food here is absolutely excellent ! Best steaks you will find in a hundred mile radius hands down and reasonably priced too . You will not find better . Unfortunately everything else here sucks . The decor . . . The service . . . And worse . . the wait . Making reservations at this place is meaningless . No matter what time you have they basically seat first come first serve . Have 6 : 30 reservations ? You will be seated by 7 : 15 . Not served by . . . SEATED by . Serving takes another 20 - 30min . Meaning you won ' t eat till almost 8 : 00 . The thing that irritates me the most is that I have seen the servers seat people who have just arrived because they know them . . . . It really comes down to whether or not you ' re willing to put up with all of that for good food . The choice is yours . . . . You have been warned : )\n",
      "Example 3585: I took my family here for the first ( and last ) time Sunday night after a movie . We had a free child ' s meal coupon and thought it might be worth a try . There was a lot of people there so that must be a good sign right ? Wrong . We were greeted , wait - that ' s the wrong word , we were ushered to a booth by an unsmiling , less than cheerful , unhappy greeter who looked as if she ' d just as soon eat us as seat us . Yay ! Off to a good start . I was still optimistic because the place looks good , it ' s new , the architecture is warm and inviting , there is a nice patio to eat on complete with cozy fire pit and the menu online promised a fresh and delicious repast ! With all that said , this place was a complete disappointment . Our first waitress brought us drinks right away and then disappeared for 15 minutes . ( BTW - The Honey Blonde beer was good . ) At this point I started timing everything for no other reason than my own entertainment during \" the wait \" . We waited and waited and waited . I had asked about the children ' s fruit - loop - licorice dog - collar making fun ( As I was directed to on the kid ' s menu and website ) and was told three times that they would bring it right out , it never came , ( like good service ) . After this we were abandoned , no refilled drinks , no food , no fruit - loop dog collars for the kiddies : ( Then we had a new waitress ! The old waitress introduced her and eventually my son ' s food came out , he ate , ten minutes went by and finally our food came . I ordered the veggie lavosh sandwich , which was okay and not a bit above \" okay \" . My husband ordered the Ahi tuna wasabi burger which he barely choked down . It was canned tuna ? made into a patty , fried and topped with wasabi sauce . He said there was nothing to bring any of the flavors together and it was just terrible , the tuna was sour , the wasabi sour , the burger sucked . My husband later said he cannot emphasize HOW BAD it was , but he didn ' t want to wait another hour to return it and get something else . It was overpriced bar food at best . We needed some ketchup and couldn ' t get any , I asked another waitress who handed it to me with a face of disgust and turned away as if too busy to confront a customer , : D Ok , busy night or not , a customer is a customer . I couldn ' t believe the service . The waitress didn ' t come back till we were done and ready for the check , it took over 15 minutes to refill my water , ( I know because i was still playing the time - game ) The table of 8 behind us called for the manager because they had a problem with their order , they all looked unhappy ! : D I knew it wasn ' t just us . It became funny after a while . We were all sharing one drink waiting for a refill that never came . The check came after another long wait , we walked out a little after 9 and had arrived at 7 . What a shame , not sure if it was the night or they were understaffed , but the food we ordered still sucked and the waitress staff was indifferent and unfriendly , and sorry for all the other Lazy Dog ' s out there that are good , but it is what it is . Never will I set foot in there again .\n",
      "Example 3586: I was lucky enough to try the chef ' s tasting menu at Tamarine , and it was certainly the best meal in my short trip to Palo Alto . I ' m not sure how 100 % authentic the Vietnamese cuisine is , but it was all delicious - the shaking beef was cooked to perfection , crab wontons were yummy and the apple dessert with coconut ice cream was fantastic . Service was also pretty amazing too - they kept note of the vegetarians / vegans in the group , brought them special dishes and kept everyone ' s glass topped up . I definitely recommend Tamarine , if only for a special occasion .\n",

We both had the 8 oz prime rib on the happy hour menu for $ 13 . 95 with soup and baked potato . We also had two margaritas each at $ 4 . 00 a piece .

      "Example 3695: Came here during Dine About Town and loved it . We had the butterfish that we served on a grilled banana leaf , and it was quite delicious as it was super moist and tender with sweet buttery taste you would expect from butterfish . The miso sauce was served on the side to give it a nicer appearance . The Hibachi was really good , but what really stole the show was the clay post rice with truffles . It was like a smokey risotto with the truffles shaved in table side . Such Amaze !\n",
      "Example 3696: I really wanted to give this place at least 4 stars based on the first few times I came here . The decor is nice and the concept was almost inspirational . The first time I came , I loved it . The second time , I still thought it was excellent . This third time was not charm I hoped it would be . The service was good enough . Made a last minute reservation through yelp ! and open table half an hour before . Got there and got seated right away . The place was packed so I guess we got lucky , granted we were only 2 . Got the two dishes I had loved previously , the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and the Crawfish Fettuccini . The food came out pretty quick , faster than I anticipated but we were happy about that . The Fettuccini was still good , although the pasta bit under cooked , and I like my pasta al dente . Its a shame cause the first time I had it , the pasta really stood out as fresh and cooked perfectly . There was also more shrimp and less crawfish than I remember . The downfall on this night was the fried chicken . For coming out so quickly , I was more worried about it being too hot , but instead , it was cold . Not it had been resting a couple of mintues luke warm , but cold , like put it in your cobb salad cold . It was cooked all the way through , so at least they don ' t get one star . Sent it back , and got it back a few minutes later , and it was a bit warmer , but not what you would expect to dine on . I wasn ' t gonna send it back again though , we ' ve all seen \" Waiting . \" The conrbread is always good here , with the fluffy , creamy butter . And it was hot ! The drinks here have always been solid because of their bacon infused bourbon . Which is really good , although really , really smokey . Try the bacon old fashioned . Final thing about this place is that its really pricey for what you get . Each dish was about $ 25 . I know the trend is increasing prices , but it all adds up . Dinner was about $ 100 for two for two entrees and three drinks . PRICEY .\n",
      "Example 3697: I don ' t know if we ordered the wrong things or what but we left this place unimpressed . Let ' s start with the Good . The imperial rolls here are good . Perfectly crispy and the seasoning had a good kick and peppery flavor . The dipping fishsauce was just okay . The fried rice was pretty good with a bit of curry to take the flavor up a notch . Now for the Bad . The other plates we had were okay to mediocre . We had and egg soup that was a little over salted . The fried fish with sweet and sour sauce felt like it was missing something . And I ' ve had way better Bo Luc Lak ( cube beef ) . And then the Ugly . The Sweet and Sour fish soup was not sour at all . I ' m pretty sure it was missing some tamarind to give it that sour twist . In fact I think that was the issue with most of the dishes , it felt like the skipped some important ingredients . I think if we had stuck to the more simple items such as the Vermicelli bowls and Imperial rolls , we would have thought it was better , since most people were ordering those items .\n",
      "Example 3698: Hidden in an industrial spot between Mission and Potrero is vast warehouse that has been converted into a giant pub . The place is super spacious but still manages to get packed ! The beer is good , I mean you really can ' t complain when you are getting pitchers of all sorts of stuff . They also serve cocktails and they have a food menu , but for the most part , people come here to share pitchers and chat it up . . . which leads to my first con . The place is extremely loud . The loft style in the open warehouse has zero to minimal sound absorption . When you first walk in , it ' s deafening , but you get used to it as the drinks flow and your voice level goes to match the surrounding noise level . Oh , and it can be cold , down right chilly , so layer up or get more liquid courage ! It is a good place to come hang out in a large group , but probably not for a smaller party where conversation becomes more important .\n",
      "Example 3699: The place was pretty small and tight , and there was a bit of a wait , but I ' m used to waiting for good lunch . Most people seemed to be ordering to go . I had the spicy miso broth which was pretty good . I described it as a \" clean \" miso taste . It wasn ' t shocking to the tastebuds , but the flavor was definitely there , and it was yummy ! The noodles had a good spring to them . However , the pork belly fell a bit short , it tasted like it was slow cooked long enough ( didn ' t break apart that easily ) . The mushrooms also tasted a bit undercooked . My friend had the salt broth , and that was pretty good as well . For being in the FiDi , I think this is one of the best Ramen places in the city proper .\n",

Sweet Meyer Lemon coupled with delicious savory , salty , oily goodness . Like potatoes , brussel sprouts are perfect vessels for oily goodness . For my main I got the burger medium . It was tasty , but by the end it was a little overwhelming with so much flavor - - bacon , white sauce , and grilled onions . It would have benefited from more lettuce / tomato / avocado to balance out the heaviness . My friend ordered the pork chops . We agreed the pork was good but a bit too fatty for our taste .

After some recommendations through friends and looking at the menu itself , I wasn ' t quite yet convinced to order a piece of their Shangri - La cake . I completely passed up the display case on my way in , so I headed back to it before the waiter took our orders . Seeing the massive white and pink ( hate that color ) wonder before my eyes was plenty enough confirmation that I had made a wise decision . As a self - proclaimed chocoholic , I shocked myself for choosing something made with white chocolate . Call me biased , but I often tend to dislike the latter because it in no way tastes like its brown , cocoa - based counterpart . I put that love / hate relationship to rest when I indulged in this slice of layered white chocolate / guava / strawberry / vanilla bliss . Although I had a preconception of it being dense , the texture was rather light . No food coma from dessert ? Awesome ! My friend had me try a bit of her chocolate croissant bread pudding .

Also split an order of Sweet Potato Tots and snuck in a few bites of their Crawfish Grits that my friend ordered . The S ' more Sundae brought on a pheNOMenal ending to our meal .

      "Example 3804: A wonderful meal that delighted and surprised my wife and I . We had just learned about Murphy Ave recently and decided to go back to that area for dinner last night . I had chosen the last restaurant ( which was kind of ' meh ' ) , so last night my wife chose Tarragon . I was really surprised on how excellent everything was . We started out with a Beef Carpaccio Crostini that smelled amazing and tasted even better . For dinner my wife had a chicken special they were running which was quite tasty and had a really nice and delicate potato pancake ; rather than the usual overly greasy ones . I had the Prime Tri - Tip and after the first bite I was impressed . It was some of the best beef I ' ve had since I moved to the bay area a year ago . The Gratin Potatoes that came with it were lightly herbed and delicious , and the veggies were awesome . Since we checkedin with FourSquare we got a free dessert to share and decided on the Butterscotch Banana Rum Cake which was so against my diet but so worth it . It was nice to have something delicious and sweet at the end without it making us feel heavy and bloated . The service was quite good and our waiter was attentive without being annoying . He even apologized for serving me before my wife because one of the plates was too hot for him to do it the other way . I thought that was quite lovely . I rarely write reviews about restaurants as most are just basic and not worth the time of writing one . Tarragon impressed me enough that I think others should try it for dinner when in the area .\n",

      "Example 3816: After spending all morning shopping for some vintage stuff , I ate one of the best argentine empanadas I ' ve ever tasted abroad ( \" Venga Empanadas \" ) . The owner , Manuel , was a really cool guy and told us to check Revolution Cafe . My brother and I only had one night to go out on San Francisco . We listened to Manuel and headed to Revolution Cafe . Once I stepped into , the enviroment was really cheerful and chill . There was an awesome jazz band who played for quite some time and kept a groovie atmosphere going on . I personally enjoy beers and I was not dissapointed at their offer . That , maybe , was the \" worst \" thing about them , they could ' ve had more brew styles . Nevertheless , the bartender was really cool and friendly . It ' s nice to be treated that good , specially when being abroad . The attendees were really into the music and made things a whole lot easier for the band . Hell , even the drum player ( on a mini break ) came to our table and had a beer and a chat about Argentina and music .

S , until yesterday night and we were a group , my husband , me , my 2 sons , my sister and her 2 kids and my father , we all ate and had desserts and the kids played , they reloaded their cards three times , then while we were eating and the kids were playing , I found my elder son 11 yrs old coming to our table crying hysterically and doesn ' t want to talk , I tried to calm him to understand , his cousin told me that they were playing with the machine that throw down sweets , and he tried to push it to let the chocolate fall down , and suddenly they found one from the security who are passing around all time , she shouted to him and told him \" don ' t move , where is your parents , you are guilty \" he was shocked , he told me he was shivering , and that she talked to him as if he is a criminal and he thought she is going to take him to the police and he won ' t see us again , he cried and told her \" I ' m sorry , I ' m sorry ' please let me go and he was crying hysterically and his cousin was with him and told her \" we did nothing , why r you talkin to us like that ? \" she told him \" shhhh \" and when she found him crying hysterically she let him go . He told me , she talked to me like a police when arresting a criminal , no one ever talked to me like that specially when she told me don ' t move , I only saw it in the movies , he was crying and shivering and the people around us noticed . I couldn ' t beleive why he is soo frightened , I ' ve never seen him like that before I asked him to go with me to her and ask her what happen but he refused , he was afraid to see her again . I went with his cousin to talk to her , her name is something like \" Serra or Sierra \" and she had all her hair cut very short and with a black framed eye - glasses . I asked her how she can stop a boy and told him \" don ' t move \" she told me that he was pushing the machine , I told her that , that was wrong , but was that the right way to deal with a kid when he does a mistake , she told me that she had 2 kids and knew well how to deal with them . She didn ' t even apologise and I found it worthless talking to her and I asked her to meet me with the manager , the manager came and she was talking to him and I didn ' t know what she had told him , he was a slim guy with an orange noticeable moustache and unfortunantely he did nothing , the only thing he said that we had to supervise our kids , I told him that , we won ' t come to this place again , and to my surprise he said \" O . K . \" We left with my son crying and hiding his face in me and you know what , all the 4 kids threw the thousands of tickets they earned and their cards in the trash outside dave and busters and they swear \" we ' ll never come to this place again \" , and I ' m going to ask the attorney , if anyone had the right to stop a kid from moving and make him cry this way . I know that kids do mistakes but when someone is in charge in a kids area , there are other ways you can speak to a kid , to warn him or to speak to his parents , not to frighten him or teat him in such a humilating way as if he is a theif and telling him \" YOU ARE GUILTY \" . I bet if she had a gun she would have pointed it up to him\n",

By the time we left , we knew why ! The food ( simple breakfast fare ) was not just terrible - it was completely inedible . Our over - medium eggs were horribly under - cooked and the hash browns mushy like they ' d been reheated several times . The grits were filled with large hard lumps . The chicken fried steak ( which I ' d so happily ordered in the past ) was nasty and the gravy was almost a solid mass of doughy lumps . Even the english muffin was soggy - not from butter but like someone had spilled water on it before serving it . Not one person in our party could manage more than a bite or two of anything on our plates . As we sat there , we noticed similar stories at the few occupied tables around us , with some customers complaining and some , like ourselves , simply pushing away their full plates in disgust . The waitress never checked on us to see how we were doing , only stopping finally when she saw our barely touched plates pushed to the edge of the table . \" Finished ? \" she asked brightly as she scooped them up and turned to dash off .

I no longer taste \" 100 % blue agave and fresh squeezed lime \" as the menu states . What I taste now is too much cane sugar and reconstituted juice . I did something I never thought I would do with a Reposado Margarita : I didn ' t drink it . To add insult to injury , the price of the now - crappy Margarita has gone up by 40 % ( during happy hour ) , or 25 % ( the rest of the time ) . I have no problem paying more for the best Margarita anywhere ( as it used to be ) , but the new recipe is no better than what I can get in a bottle from Safeway .

      "Example 4105: I ' ve been to Sakura Chaya multiple times . The first few times the service was great and the food was good . However , the last 3 times I ' ve gone the service wasn ' t so great and on my mother ' s birthday lunch the management was disrespectful and I won ' t be going back . On 11 / 24 / 13 we went for teppan yaki and the wait was 45 minutes , which is fine because it was busy . My family and I went to the bar and had some drinks , my brother went up to the front the restaurant and told the hostess who took down our name that we were going to be in the back and to make sure and go get us . The hostess called for other customer names at the bar 3 times while we were waiting so we assumed all would be fine . After an hour we hadn ' t been called and we inquired about why . The hostess stared wide eyed and stated that the manager crossed our names off the list . Obviously we were upset , and were told they would get us seated in 5 minutes . 20 minutes later we still hadn ' t been sat . Not only does the manager not take any responsibility for the mishap he blamed us for not hearing him call our names and was incredibly condescending and insincere , stating how busy it was . I ' ve worked in the dining industry for years ( not anymore but I have 6 years experience ) and this was simply someone with no customer service ability , which I guess he ( the manager ) thinks he could get away with because this is a fairly popular restaurant . When we got sat to eat ( with people who showed up at least 45 minutes after us ) we were pretty upset about the whole situation and when the plates they brought us were not fully cleaned and had rice sticking all over multiple plates we simply got up and left . By all means go if you want , but this place has some horrendous customer service and the manager ' s are so clueless about human interaction . I won ' t be going back . The only nice thing I can say is at least the bar tender was very nice and courteous , he could teach that manager how to do customer service .\n",

Appetizers that are meant to be eaten hot are not appetizing when they are cold , so of course most of them did not get eaten . The wait staff was no where to be found . When I called to complain the next day for their lack of service I was given excuse after excuse . The appetizers stopped being passed because no one was taking them . ? ? ? ! ! Is this really your excuse Zibibbo ? I paid for passed appetizers ! I don ' t care if the waiters stood there with trays in their hands all night . When i asked to be compensated , I was given the measly server fee of $ 150 . I paid over 8 grand for the event , surely my dissatisfaction is worth more than that , especially since I got nowhere near what I paid for .

Burger Bar ) . But this place made me jealous ! I wish we had a Riders Club in Los Angeles as these burgers were incredible .

I do have a bit of a love - hate with Extraordinary Desserts though The decorations on the food are ALWAYS beautiful . Gold fleck , rose petals , the whole 9 yards . But almost always the taste can ' t match up to the looks . I think i ' ve had two cakes ever that really stood out to me as being delicious , but most of them just look beautiful and the taste doesn ' t really compare . I still love to come here as its an awesome date spot and the selection changes regularly , but it is a bit of a taste bud Russian Roulette at times .

      "Example 4179: This review is from my dining experience on Feb 2 , 2013 This morning I had breakfast with two of my girlfriends Ronda and Lisa , and I decided to share with everyone my overall dining experience at Corky ' s Kitchen & Bakery . This is now my third time having breakfast with friends at Corky ' s Kitchen & Bakery in Rancho Cucamonga , CA . Corky ' s has that 70 ' s classic Diner & Coffee Shop atmosphere where you feel you are right at home . Each I have been there the place is packed . What ' s makes Corky ' s stand apart from other restaurant chains , is the food is really good , as for the portion size ? Well , you will not leave hungry and most likely you will leave with a \" doggie bag \" . The feel is very warm and inviting . So far I have had the Belgian Waffle , you could taste vanilla in every bite , was soft on the inside and firm on the outside . The second time I had the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Combo , amazing wasn ' t overly sweet and just the right amount of cinnamon . Today I decided to stick with two eggs and bacon with a side of hash browns . Once again the food was great , and I left with yet another \" doggie bag \" My breakfast today . By the way this is not your standard 8 in plate . Try maybe 12 . . . For such a busy restaurant the service has been good each time , people are waiting to get seated , and for good reason . Corky ' s also sells a variety of pies , cheese cake , muffins , and cookies . This is the Inland Empire ' s best kept secret . Just outside Corky ' s Kitchen & Bakery is a banner that proudly announces they were \" VOTED BEST FAMILY RESTAURANT of 2012 \" If you find yourself on the 10 or 210 freeway in San Bernardino county , Ca do yourself a huge favor and treat yourself to a filling and terrific meal , that won ' t bust your pocket - book either .\n",

The restaurant manager was super to work with - she let us make a reservation for 60 people and did NOT require a deposit ! The service was really super , each of our servers was gracious and polite , but most importantly , they were super attentive .

Right outside the door was a giant play area , so the kids ordered and then played , ate and then played , and so on . And we could see them the whole time through the beautiful floor to ceiling glass windows . That allowed all of the adults to easily mingle and say hello to each other , have a drink before dinner and relax without having to worry about the children too much . There is no possible way we could have had a better set - up for 25 young kids in a restaurant . And last but not least , there was the food . We had suggested Joe ' s to the group because we had previously eaten at one in Sacramento before and had a good experience . However , virtually no one else in our group had ever been to a Joe ' s . At the end our dinner though , every one of them commented how great the food was , and how great the service was ( all kids meals came out together , then all adult meals came out just behind that ) .

      "Example 4314: This review was from my third visit to Chelokababi and I have successfully tried most if not all of their dishes and experienced the ambience and service across three visits . Chelokababi is a well - reviewed sit down Persian place in Sunnyvale , right next to the roti place , Rajjot ( I ’ ll review this place someday ) . We were a party of four with two kids in tow last night . The place was packed as usual as has been the case in every one of my trips . They do take reservations and on a weekend night , I would strongly recommend one for any party over 2 . Persian cuisine is an interesting experience for the vegetarian Indian . It has elements of flavored rice but the spice content is lower . On the curry ’ s and dishes side , there are lot more differences between the Persian flavors and their Indian counterparts . For more on Persian cuisine , head over to wikipedia . Two of the guests consider Chelokababi as one of their favorite spots and knew their way around with the menu . My wife was making her first trip to the place and was taking in opinions on recommended dishes . The little guys were yapping away in the midst . Thanks to some much welcome complementary pita bread and butter ( yep , for all the fanciness you dont get complementary hummus - 1 ) and the obligatory iPhone , the boys were quickly silenced . We ordered a vegetarian platter with Kashko Bademjan ( eggplant based curry ) , hummus , olives , falafel and a salad . I ordered a personal favorite - the Persian tea . A friend ordered their unique Dough , which is a yoghurt soda . The appetizer platter was well received ( the salad untouched ) and the tea hit all the right notes for me . The yoghurt soda was not as popular . For the main course , we ordered some vegetarian soup , the Ash Reshteh and one of us wanted their salad ( yep , there was a dieting fiend in our midst ) . I personally found the soup a little bland and while it had interesting elements to it , felt a tad dull . Would have liked a little more spice to it . My wife didnt enjoy the soup much either . The same blandness complaint . The salad was received well . The other orders for the main course included the Vegetarian Gheymeh , a gumbo like concoction that is part soup , part porridge . This was relatively well received . We also had the Zeresh Polo as a side order which was very good too . We wrapped up with some delicious tasting yet a tad expensive baklava . It was a fun night peppered with good food and good company .\n",
      "Example 4315: I have reviewed the food offered by Sweet Tomatoes during my trip to their Sunnyvale location . The relatively new location on North 1st St offers the same kind of fare . The reason I wanted to review this location separately is for two reasons . 1 . This location is newer and much more cleaner . To me , it felt like the fare was also more sophisticated and more fresh but that might be partially due to the newness of the location . 2 . The place gets pretty crowded during lunch hour thanks to Brocade and Lam Research next door . The food was good . As always , I love the variety of veggies that Sweet Tomatoes offers . Their vegetarian friendly soup offerings are also very good . I am a big fan of the place and can recommend it to everyone .\n",
      "Example 4316: So most of you in the Bay Area have been to Fresh Choice . Sweet Tomatoes is very similar to Fresh Choice with very little to differentiate between the two . But I will review the two places independently so you get a feel for what it offers . The branch of Sweet Tomatoes we visited was in Sunnyvale , next to the big hulking Costco . The place was packed for lunch on a warm Saturday afternoon when we descended with a big group . We were seated fairly quickly due to the constantly moving crowd . The entrance fee as I like to call it was similar to the one at Fresh Choice and we started gathering our veggies and fruits . I was pleasantly surprised to find a kids only plate at a lower cost and also a much wider salad bar than the one at Fresh Choice . I liked the overall arrangement of salad items and their choice of dressings . The fee paid , we got access to the pizza and soup sections of the restaurant . The pizzas were warm and the soups were tasty . There were two vegetarian options out of 3 soups which was good . The breads and pastries available were sumptuous and tasty . In the dessert section , there was very limited choice , not different from Fresh Choice . Overall , it was a good lunch . I will refrain from rating the place under individual categories given the nature of the place but suffice to say , I will be going there again .\n",
      "Example 4317: It was a special occasion that warranted a weekday dinner out . We were in the mood to try a new place . I had heard good things about the Oaxacan place in downtown San Jose , Mezcal and decided to give it a shot . This is my brief review of our dinner at Mezcal . We arrived fairly late because it was a last minute dinner decision . Given the downtown San Jose location , we had to settle for paid parking across the street in the KQED building garage . We arrived to a relatively busy place for a Monday night – it looked like lots of office dinners were going on . On first glance , the Cinco de Mayo / Halloween vibe of the place was striking and very unique . On further investigation , we came to know that one of the folks working in the restaurant has produced some of the art which was wonderfully unique . On perusing the menu , we identified quite a few vegetarian dishes . One downer was the fact that one of the key elements of Oaxacan cusine , the Mole sauce was made with chicken stock at Mezcal . Bummer ! . We ordered a side of guacamole to go with the complimentary chips and salsa for appetizer . The guacamole was made fresh and tasty . The salsa had a nice spicy punch to it . For the main course , my wife chose a vegetarian tlayuda , a crunchy tortilla shell filled with a bunch of veggies , cheese and sauce . I picked vegetarian enchilada suizas with tomatillo sauce . The little guy got himself a cheese quesadilla . The food arrived in about 10 - 15 minutes . I liked my enchilada and the tomatillo sauce was very tasty . My wife liked the filling in the tlayuda but not the crunchy shell which was extremely hard to break away and eat with the stuffing inside . It was awkward . The kid ’ s cheese quesadilla was good ( and cheesy ) . Service was pretty good . Folks were extra friendly . And the little guy charmed them to get a complimentary ice cream at the end . Overall , we liked the food but were not wowed by it . It is worth a repeat trip sometime .\n",
      "Example 4318: My wife was in the mood for some good Italian food in the Sunnyvale - Mountain View area within a short distance from our workplaces . Vaso Azzurro fit the bill and carried good reviews in Yelp ! . So here is my review of the place . Location : The Italian restaurant is one of the first in a line of great eats in Castro St . Seating : We had to wait a couple of minutes to get seated , not because it was full but because the ma î tre d ’ was busy talking to someone in Italian . We managed to get a seat outside . The restaurant seemed busy for a weekday lunch but they had enough seats outside ( and inside if we wanted ) . Appetizers : Anticipating a heavy lunch , we skipped ordering any antipasti . We were offered bread with dipping oil . The bread was very tasty and had a flavor of its own and the dipping oil had herbs in it that made it a nice starting piece . Main Course : My wife ordered a Penne Alla Diavola and I ordered a Ravioli Con Spinaci Di Mascarpone . In non - Italian terms , the Penne dish came with bunch of veggies most notably chunks of eggplant . My spinach ravioli was filled with ricotta cheese and came in a marinara - mascarpone sauce . The penne was good but nothing special . The spinach ravioli was good but the marinara - mascarpone sauce was heavenly . It elevated the ravioli to new levels of exuberance . Dessert : We were already full but Yelp ! reviewers had raved about the Tiramusu . The dessert came in pretty quick and was to die for . A hint of chocolate made it a tad bitter - but to good effect . Loved it . Summary : We enjoyed the warm afternoon out eating fun Italian food .\n",
      "Example 4319: This was my fourth trip to the place . The last three bizarrely happened in a span of 3 days during Christmas last year . I needed a break - not from their tasty food but from the richness of it . I returned back to the restaurant this week . There was some amount of excitement - we were meeting a friend from long ago . Plus , there was the food at Vive Sol . Vive Sol offers food they claim is authentic to the Puebla region of Mexico . I have no knowledge about the place or its cuisine . Suffice to say , it tastes good . The rest of the group was already seated on a busy Friday night when I walked in . For a change , I knew exactly what I wanted to eat . So the menu was just an afterthought . Appetizers are interesting in Vive Sol . None so that the free tortilla chips which comes with two exciting salsas . Both of the salsas are spicy and tingly . Add some guacamole as a side order and it makes for an excellent and relatively cheap appetizer . Their menu offers other interesting appetizers . Their chalupa is worth trying as an appetizer . Just remember to not think of the one you get in Taco Bell . I did order a virgin peach margarita which was lovely . Vive Sol ’ s speciality in my opinion is their wonderful rendition of guajillo sauce . I tasted this sauce for the first time in Vive Sol and fell in love with it instantly . I have since recommended it to multiple friends who all ended up enjoying it just as much . Guajillo is a type of chili pepper fairly common in Mexico . Surprisingly , I have not come across the pepper much . Vive Sol uses this pepper to great effect in a creamy sauce that is just about the right spice level and perfect . I had a veggie burrito with Guajillo sauce which was awesome . It paired well with the Spanish rice and beans on the side . Portions can be deceiving . If one gorges on the tortilla chips prior to the entree , the portion is perfectly adequate for dinner . For lunch , it depends on the hunger factor . Overall , I am a happy camper at Vive Sol and would recommend it very strongly .\n",

      "Example 4360: Bjs use to have the best late night happy hour menu . . . just appetizers and mini pizzas half price . . . now they have this special happy hour menu where is looks like they have the same dishes at approximately the same price but in reality all the happy got dishes are now miniaturized . Angus sliders . . . used to get 4sliders plus fries . . . now you get 2 sliders . Boneless chicken wings . . . used to be a full serving with 10 - 15 nuggets . . . now 5 tiny Costco style mini nuggets with 3 sticks of celery and a tiny thimble of sauce . . . the worst part is that they charge about the same amount as the old happy hour for about half the food . . . happy hour is now disappointment hour at bj ' s .\n",
      "Example 4361: I ' m a college student who often stays here with my father ( probably over 6 times ) , and I won ' t have the most detailed review or be the most picky . Normally , I stay here on my route from Berkeley down to SoCal or Vice Versa , and I have to say that the rooms are great . The view of the Bay is tremendous , and the layout of the beds and table are generally spacious . The bathrooms are clean , and the staff is pretty accommodating ( as we ' ve asked for small random things many times . ) I ' ve never eaten here , but the hotel is right next to enough great restaurants that it ' s never been a problem . The hotel is always seconds away from the freeway , and 10 minutes away from Berkeley . It looks like I ' m celebrating this place , but I guess nothing bugs me about it .\n",
      "Example 4362: Something told me that there just had to be more to it than what we experienced the first go around , and we were right . While waiting for our table , my friend and I cased the desserts to find the best of the best to try , and even asked the hostesses for input . One waitress said that the croissant bread pudding was on the guests ' \" top ten list of things to eat before you die . \" When we were finally seated , having not eaten dinner yet , and not being one to just eat dessert for dinner we got an aged ham and mozzarella panini , for $ 15 I expected a lot more of a sandwich . Dessert time , we got the bread pudding and she was right . This went beyond extraordinary . With our candle relit , we decided to take the chocolate strudel home . Also amazing . A must see for every trip to San Diego . Rating stays low because while the food can be simply amazing it really depends on what you get , prices are high , wait is too long , and service is just okay .\n",
      "Example 4363: I hate giving 1 star , but it falls into the category of Methinks not . I was dragged here without choice . . . . I think the real name should be \" 5 Guys that tried In N Out and is trying to copy them \" Start up costs must be a lot , considering the burgers are like double the price of their cometitors . If I were looking to spend $ 6 on a burger I would go to a Full Service Restaurant . . . Islands or Red Robin which also include unlimited fries for the $ 6 . - 7 Fries were nothing to speak of , they offer a few more condiments on the burgers , but nothing I would order . I guess the big difference is they also sell Hot Dogs . Yippie ! The restaurant itself was small and cramped , we could not get to tables without making other people get up from their tables to let us by . Constantly bumping the backs of chairs together every time someone moves . I would not go back .\n",
      "Example 4364: Had dinner here the other night and it was mediocre , actually didn ' t come out right and had to be sent back . Second time it was nearly perfect , but with 2 tries I would think it would be perfect . There are many diverse things to eat off the menu , the real problem is narrowing it down . The second problem is that the portions are so huge , that we shared an entree and still didn ' t have room for cheesecake . = ( The restaurant is in a huge mall , depending when you go the parking lot can be a challenge to navigate and park .\n",
      "Example 4365: Was pretty good , we had dinner here . Dining is outside on a \" patio \" between the bakery and Fortuocity shop . We had an open - faced meatloaf sandwich . It was pretty good , in fact better than the meatloaf served at WDW . It was a lot of food , which we shared and were satisfied so that we did not have room for dessert . Sometime we hope to get the Matterhorn Ice Cream Sundae .\n",
      "Example 4366: The Magic is gone from the Blue Bayou ! I could not believe this myself . Especially after having worked at Disneyland decades ago . First , at 10 : 00 am tried to get a reservation , there were none , none for lunch or dinner at all . As we were waiting for others in our group to catch up the hostesses were taking reservations over the phone and by walk up for weeks , even months in advance . Second , they only offer the Monte Crisco , which in my opinion is the only reason for eating there , for lunch now . A change that is not posted on the menu board in front of the restaurant . Except at Lunch it is listed , but then at Dinner it is missing . Third , they no longer offer food to go ; I have fond memories of getting a Monte Crisco and taking it to the French Market to eat , so now the only way to enjoy one is to call way in advance and get a reservation to dine in . The comment , the Magic is gone , applies to the rude hostesses at the desk . The laughter of the concept of someone thinking they could get a reservation for the same day . The dumbfounded looks that someone would actually want a Monte Crisco for dinner ( how about at all , thinking about what it is and today ' s culture of Atkins . . . a sandwich of turkey , ham and cheese on French toast then deep fried and sprinkled with powdered sugar and jelly . ) Also , the bewilderment that someone would want to get food to go , especially since you can not eat there without advance reservation . Needless to say I did not actually eat there , but felt the review applies to anyone interested in eating there . I would have if I could have gotten in . You can get reservations for Blue Bayou by calling 714 - 781 - DINE ( 3463 )\n",
      "Example 4367: Cafe Jacqueline is one of my favorite places to bring visitors , as it is such a unique experience . The short version is that it is a charming french cafe , serving basically only souffle ( savory and sweet ) . But that doesn ' t really do it justice . Cafe Jacqueline is one place , that no matter how hard I try to describe it , you won ' t really understand it unless you go visit yourself . Which you should do ! This is a long meal , which is part of what makes the experience . You will be there for several hours , and unlike doing a tasting menu you won ' t be interrupted by food , so you sure better have something to talk about ! Order some amazing wine , enjoy your soup , and just sit back , relax , and wait for more delicious things to come your way .

Although I had already ordered ice tea to drink , she continued to push the alcohol concoctions . I had the fried shrimp and my husband had the snapper . The food was very good . We were only half way through our meal when our waitress came back to let us know what desert she liked best off the menu and asked us which one we would like to order . I told her I wasn ' t even finished with my meal and I would be shoved into ordering . We didn ' t see her again until it came time to pick up the check .

      "Example 4382: This is a review of Bobcha @ Soma Streat Food Park . As I have gotten older , and my metabolism has slowed to about half speed , I have had to make some very unfortunate sacrifices , including downgrading my carb intake from thick sliced white bread and an extra serving of Japanese rice every day , to veggies and wheat bread or other alternatives . Ofcourse for the sake of my mental sanity I have my occasional cheat day , and when I do I want each gram of carbs and sugar to be really worthwhile . I was sad when I spent that day at Bobcha . This is a review of Bobcha @ Soma Street Food Park . Bacon Bulgogi Burrito ( $ 7 . 75 ) add egg ( $ 1 ) - 2 STARS . This burrito , which should by default include both kimchi and an egg ( $ 1 extra each ) , was dissatisfying but large . The meat was low quality , but worse yet was the overly sweet red sauce that ruined the entire burrito . It was chock full of very mediocre non - bacony rice , and the very hard cooked egg was no saving grace . John ' s Snack Deli is still by far my favorite spot for a Korean Burrito .

There was nothing that kissed a beat from the amuse bouche to the petite fours for dessert . I started with glazed oysters with Osetra caviar and lettuce cream which was satisfying on several levels . The texture was true to the wonderful brininess of both the oyster and caviar and literally exploded in your mouth , the cream sauce that the four plump oysters bathed in was rich and lightly smokey complimented by the lettuce and salsify puree . The lobster and potatoes with morel mushrooms followed . The sweetness of the lobster and creamy morel infused potatoes were perfectly balanced in their richness and at the same time , they were almost insufferably rich but it never crossed that line . Excellently prepared duck and venison dishes followed . I ' ve not had as good duck or venison anywhere , perfectly prepared , appropriately spiced and exquisitely presented . The service was seamless and super attentive without being intrusive ( that alone is a major accomplishment ) . All in all , this was a perfect meal ! Thank you Gary Danko .

The food was good but it wasn ' t amazing , especially since the lowest price plate is just under $ 30 . If you want a big plate of meat I guess this is the spot but you ' ll be paying big for it since the veg is a bit skimped on . I wouldn ' t say it was worth eating here since the food was quite expensive for what you get and there is no alcohol in the park . So you get a nice expensive meal but no wine and a very small menu . Sure I expect a park restaurant to cost a bit more but I don ' t think you get what you pay for compared to a five minute walk out of the park .

It would ' ve been a shorter wait , if the group of ladies before us didn ' t take there sweet sweet time to eat and pay the bill . They obviously saw us standing in the cold , and still had no desire or sympathy to finish quicker . Anyways , the menu is pretty easy . Pick your soup base and pick your toppings at $ 1 each . $ 8 for a bowl of ramen with only ONE slice of pork and some green onions is pretty steep . If you want a better broth , it ' s about $ 1 - 2 extra , and to add extra toppings is $ 1 per item . Really ? $ 1 for a hard boiled egg , or $ 1 for some corn ? ? So not worth it . Let ' s start with the broth . MSG MUCH ? ? I got the spicy miso ( not spicy at all ) , and by the end of my meal , I was so thirsty . This lasted throughout the day . Ugh , disgusting ! Definitely not home - made soup bases , and rather just powdered packets from the supermarket or something . Ramen itself was decent , though the portion was kind of small for $ 8 . Pork was not good . It didn ' t have much flavor , and rather bland . And only one thin slice of pork ? REALLLY ? ? ? ? ? Not sure if I would go again . . it ' s also cash only so super inconvenient . At the end when my coworkers and I paid separately ( $ 20 each since we just pulled out cash from the ATM knowing that it was a cash only place ) . . the waitress was like \" Well , this makes it hard for us to give change \" . Well maybe if you didn ' t have a stupid cash only policy , this wouldn ' t happen ! I mean , most people are gonna be coming in with $ 20s , so either get more $ 1 and $ 5 bills , or start accepting credit cards . Not even a competition for Ramen Dojo in San Mateo .

Apart from a long and loud blast of feedback , which is actually forgivable , it was evident that the engineer did not know who was being featured much of the time or didn ' t care , as soloists were left buried in the mix and singers were almost inaudible at times .

The gnocchi ' s themselves were good , but the sauce was too salty to eat . I choose to take the whole plate home so that I can rinse them off and make my own sauce for them ( and I told the waitress that I was doing that ) since that is the only way to make them edible . The ravioli were so salty that they were * completely * inedible , even with the sauce scraped off . We had to send it back uneaten . To add insult to injury , when they brought out the check , after trying to push us into ordering dessert ( not free ) , they charged us full price for everything . I had to tell the waitress , politely , that I wouldn ' t pay for the , inedible , ravioli . I had expected it to be comped since it wasn ' t eaten . I also hoped that the gnocchi would be discounted since I was going to have to remake it myself to make edible . The ravioli was taken off the final ticket . But it took probably 15 minutes to get the fixed ticket , even though there was only two other people in the restaurant , and they were obviously friends of the employees .

      "Example 4595: I had previously been a repeat customer of this hotel but I absolutely will not give them my business in the future . Not only did they misplace my reservation but they were under construction and provided no prior notice ( likely due to the missing reservation ) . My plans involved use of their lobby space which was unavailable due to the construction . When I asked about possible alternatives the catering service organization took over the transactions and from that point it was a nightmare . I was left waiting for hours to try and set up a room reservation and then when I did the price they expected me to pay was outrageous , particularly given the circumstances . After coming to an agreement on a price and signing a contract to that effect I expected it to be smooth sailing from there , foolish . When I arrived at the conference room I had reserved there was no sign indicating my event and the room was clearly dirty and had not been set up for this event but instead had the left over setting from a previous event . The contract stated that water would be provided which it was not and that signs would be posted in the lobby as well as on the door indicating the event and the change in accommodation . After calling down to the front desk to see about signs they were eventually able to solve that particular problem . On the following day I again arrived at the room to find no signs indicating the event and found the room to be locked . I was eventually able to track down a member of the hotel staff to have the room unlocked but by the time it was available it was well into the scheduled start time of the event . In addition to this once I was able to gain entry into the room I discovered that the room had been cleared out . While table and chairs were present there was no set up for the event as had been indicated in the contract and the catering department management was nowhere to be found . Water was brought up later on the second day of the event by the building manager who was extremely helpful once he realized what had happened . Ultimately when I tried to submit a review of my stay to the hotel their web interface refused to accept my review even after multiple attempts . In addition to the mess with the catering I also had to follow up with the hotel based on erroneous charges to my credit card . This follow up entailed numerous phone calls and emails with minimal response if any and a total lack of professionalism or comprehension on the part of the catering manager . To top it all off , the email from Hilton that finally resolved the issues with the charges came seconds after I had left a message with the catering manager , who was supposedly out of the office , requesting a returned phone call . I would strongly discourage anybody from providing this hotel with future business , especially if you are looking to reserve an event space .\n",

      "Example 4640: I love Five Guys Burgers . I read comments that they are trying to copy IN and OUT ! ? These people obviously do not read about the History of Five Guys or In and Out ! In - N - Out Burger is a regional chain of fast food restaurants with locations in five western states in United States . Founded in 1948 establishing the first In - N - Out burger in Baldwin Park , California , and headquartered in Irvine , In - N - Out Burger has slowly expanded outside Southern California into the rest of the state as well as into Washington , Arizona , Nevada , Utah , and Texas . As of February 2013 , In - N - Out employed 18 , 000 staff and had 291 locations . Five Guys Enterprises , doing business as Five Guys , is a fast casual restaurant chain focused on hamburgers , hot dogs , and French fries , with its headquarters in the Lorton community in unincorporated Fairfax County , Virginia . The first Five Guys restaurant opened in 1986 in Arlington County , Virginia , and between 1986 and 2001 , the chain expanded to five locations scattered through the Washington , D . C . metro area . In early 2003 , the chain began franchising , opening the doors to rapid expansion . In just a year and a half , permits had been sold for over 300 franchised locations , catching the attention of the national restaurant industry . As of 2012 , Five Guys has over 1000 locations open throughout the United States and Canada and over 1500 locations under development . The company is the fastest - growing fast food chain in the United States , with a 32 . 8 % sales increase from 2010 to 2011 . The In - N - Out menu consists of three burger varieties : hamburger , cheeseburger , and \" Double - Double \" ( double meat / double cheese ) . French fries and fountain drinks are available , as well as three flavors of milkshakes . The hamburgers come with lettuce , tomato , with or without onions ( the customer is asked upon ordering , and may have them fresh or grilled ) , and a sauce , which is called \" spread \" ( a Thousand Island dressing variant ) . The Five Guys menu is centered on hamburgers offered with American cheese or bacon , kosher style hot dogs , grilled cheese and vegetable sandwiches . Five Guys uses buns that are sweeter and \" eggier \" than normal buns . [ French fries are the sole side item , available salted only in \" Five Guys style \" or seasoned \" Cajun style \" . Complimentary roasted in - shell peanuts are offered for on - site consumption at most locations , with signage alerting potential customers who may have a peanut allergy . Peanuts are not permitted to be taken out of the restaurant , out of concern for spreading the allergen . There is differences between the two and it is not fair to say Five Guys is copying In and Out . Know the story before you accuse a Restaurant of copy cat . It is a persons choice to pay less or more for a hamburger . There are alot of choices regarding style and cost of hamburgers . Have fun and enjoy !\n",

I called my server over , and told him it was not what I expected , and the fries looked old like they had been cooked an hour prior . He asked me if I wanted another order of fries , no mention of a replacement for the nasty fish . The replacement order of fries was only slightly better and that ' s when I put 2 and 2 together and deemed the oil hadn ' t been changed in a few thousand miles . I quietly told the server this and he just half smiled and didn ' t even take anything off my check .

I won ' t be back ever . IF I could give a negative 5 stars I would . The decor needs some refreshing as well , you ' d be amazed at what a coat of paint would do .

      "Example 4705: The food at Chelokababi is tasty , albeit overpriced . If you are looking for a nice persian restaurant to enjoy a meal and conversation , this would be a great place . The atmosphere is nice without conveying stiffness or formality and there is a good amount of space between tables . Beautiful persian decorations adorn the entrance and some gorgeous teapots from Iran were on display inside . * * appetizers * * The MIDDLE EASTERN PLATTER is great to share if you ' re dining with a group . Standouts were the HUMMUS , KASHKO BADEMJAN ( tasty eggplant spread ) , and OLOVIEH ( a twist on a chicken salad ) . We also ordered the COOCO SABZI which was described as a vegetable quiche on the menu . This turned out to be a burnt blob of green mush , charred brown on the outside . The texture was spongy , similar to that of a microwave dinner brownie . * entrees * My favorites out of our entrees was the JOOJEH KABAB - - succulent and juicy chicken grilled to perfection and oozing with flavor . The KABAB BARG was a close second , the tender center cut fillet mignon paired perfectly with saffron rice , raw onion , and grilled tomato . I ' m slightly concerned that the rice portion is double or triple that of typical rice service . We had an inordinate amount of rice over but no meat leftovers to eat it with . * * sides * * I suggest ordering one of the yogurt sides to enjoy with your kababs . My dad and I preferred the cooler and refreshing MASTO KHIAR with cucumbers while my mom and boyfriend insisted that the flavorful MASTO MOSEER with shallots was the better of the two . * * drinks * * I decided to try the SEKANJEBIN ( shredded cucumbers and sekanjebin syrup ) which was not necessarily bad , but much to sweet for my preference . My dad loves the DOUGH ( yogurt soda ) . All in all , we enjoyed our meal and I would probably return , despite the high prices . However , our overall service was a strange experience . We were served by two different Persian ladies ( perhaps they were the owners or managers ) . I ' m not sure if they were playing good cop , bad cop ; one was so amicable and answered all our questions about the menu while the other was curt and , at times , disdainful .\n",
      "Example 4706: If you are in the mood for a heavy and hearty all - american brunch , you have come to the right place . My boyfriend and I shared the full stack Banana Macadamia nut & Coconut Pancakes ( true to our asian roots , we could not resist the economies of scale savings that 3 pancake - full stack offered ) . Combined with an applewood bacon avocado omelette , this was WAY too much food . Both dishes were delicious , but as I ate more and more all I could think about was grease clogging my arteries . I personally prefer lighter fare so this was not my favorite meal in terms of nutrition but any brunch fanatic would truly enjoy it . They were busy when we went on a Sunday morning and I believe the slow and sparse service was exacerbated by the fact that we were seated outside . While you wait for a table , you can enjoy complimentary coffee on the balcony .\n",
      "Example 4707: This Umami burger location opened earlier this summer and I think things could be improved in terms of cooking and service . I ' ve dined here 4 times since it opened and the burger ' s haven ' t been consistent . The burgers have been soggy ( once the bottom bun of my friend ' s umami burger was soaked in beef juice ) and servers have not been attentive ( waited a long time to order and had to flag them down repeatedly for water and to pay the bill ) .

      "Example 4746: Went to NOLA for dinner on Thursday night with my girlfriend and the 1st thing that I noticed was odd was the fact that the doors to the restaurant were wide open . It wouldn ' t be a problem but it ' s 50 degrees outside with a cold breeze and some rain . There was no hostess or host to seat us , just a sign telling us to seat ourselves and the only tables available were the ones by the wide open doors . We waited at the cold corner tables by the door for 15 minutes before Santos , our waiter came by . He said he didn ' t see us but it ' s hard to miss 2 people at a table surrounded by empty tables , when the rest of the tables in the restaurant were full . Doesn ' t make any sense to me . Now the food review , I got the pasta jambalaya and my girlfriend got the prime ribeye . The jambalaya was sub - par . Was nice and piping hot but that ' s the only thing I can complement NOLA on . My girlfriend ' s ribeye was delicious looking but that wasn ' t the case . It was room temperature at best and it had very rubbery parts to it which I don ' t recall any prime steaks I ' ve had before having that . The sides of spinach and mashed potatoes tasted like they were frozen at one point . On a upside the music and the cocktail drinks were good , but we couldn ' t really enjoy the jazz music because they sat us at a table surrounded by two large and loud parties . Overall I wouldn ' t recommend coming here unless you ' re here for the drinks and the jazz music . Only reason we ended up coming to NOLA was the deal we got on Travelzoo . At least we didn ' t pay full price for a disappointing experience .\n",

The girls seem to spend more time standing around talking to each other than doing their jobs and taking care of customers . Hot girls are a plus but it ' s a sports bar first , not a strip joint so the food and service should be at least mediocre to be acceptable .

Burgers and wings are good . Decor is cool , but restaurant music was a bit of a mood killer . I know economy is struggling but a better customer service base would be nice . Owner tends to favor big wig people of the community and certain races . We ' re nobodies therefore he really made us feel that way . I would recommend this place if it felt more comfortable going in and if prices weren ' t too extreme . Just not inviting . I rather drive 40 mins to get a bite to eat than spend money here . . . . sadly .\n",
      "Example 4756: Mountain View is not exactly a mecca of great food but this place has been decent enough to return to twice on one trip . It is definitely very crowded and noisy , but they seem ruthlessly efficient and so cover turnover is high . Unlike other reviewers I quite like the seating process - you stand in line with your menu , pick and pay for your food and then they help find you table and bring you food and drinks . It means there is no seeking someone out to pay the cheque , although if you are missing something or in need of a top up then you might be out of luck . The food is decent enough , although nothing special and the portions are ridiclous . The blueberry oatmeal pancake was probably the highlight of my first visit ( we asked for one pancake as a stack of three was huge ) , although the Huevos Rancheros were good too . I liked the fries that came with my club sandwich on the second trip but the rest of the dish was a little boring and tasteless . Given the limited choices in Mountain View , and in light of the late opening hours , I would definitely return to Crepevine , with a serious appetite so as to tackle the big portions perhaps .\n",

Back then you could order your Beer in 1 / 2 , 1 , and 2 liter GLASS BOOT steins . Sadly the cost of the glassware has caused those days to go the way of the Albatross . I however still have MINE safely protected from whatever forces would separate us . The food is good hearty and satisfying .

Our server MiMi finally came after 8 minutes of sitting at a table . Never introduced herself , I had to ask . But anyhow , we her our order . I ordered a cup of ice , when she brought the cup of ice , the cup was half full , and ice was melted . Like the cup had been sitting .

They came out right , and hot . But we haven ' t seen our server MiMi ( with the nose ring , which by the way is not professional especially in a Resturant setting ) since she brought back the cup of ice . The first time , no refills . So Edgar came and brought out the check . I ask where ' s our server . He replies she ' s gone for the night . So I ' m thinking you mean to tell me the lil heffa couldn ' t even come and relieve her self properly , and introduce us to new server . No tip left for either server . By the way Edgar was the smiling waiter who had giving us the wait a minute gesture and never came back . Food was good , service sucked . They don ' t have Resturant etiquette .

About 615 the bouncer told us we weren ' t wearing proper attire , so we went back to our room and changed . We were gone a mere 15min . but when we got back the same bouncer told us we couldn ' t get back in without a wristband . The wristbands were $ 20 . . . EACH .

At one point , he want so far as to blatantly call my friends and I liars . When we talked with the gal , she wasn ' t even willing to cut our group a deal .

      "Example 4808: The food is out of this world ! As someone who is both vegan and gluten - free ( I know . . . hard life ) it is amazing to be able to enjoy an actual desert at a restaurant rather than a scoop of sorbet . I have only dined at the bar so can only speak to the service there , which is TERRIBLE . I have a feeling that siting anywehre else is a much greater experience , as the food runner all three nights I dined there was more educated than my bartender and remembered me everytime I came in . Regardless of the terrible service and sitting at a bar covered in paperwork and receipts ( at 9P when they stop seating at 9 : 30 ! ? ) I would still come back for the great food .\n",

You go to a counter and order the food you want , and then someone brings it out to you . We split mac and cheese , a steak salad , and anchor steam beer battered onion rings .

Service was wonderful - - great knowledgable waiter . Complimentary bread ( several choices , was warm ) . I opted for the olive bread which was yummy . My boyfriend and I split a bottle of French Malbec . Although they had a tasting menu , we opted to just order from the regular menu since the tasting menu had 3 courses of dessert and the courses we liked were also on the regular menu ( and very glad we did ! ) . I started with the roasted quail & speck served with asparagus , Crispy Levain , Fromage Blanc , Tarragon ( description direct from the menu ) . It was delicious . Presentation was beautiful . My boyfriend ordered the seared diver scallop and abalone with duck consumme . He thought it was delicious as well . For our entrees , I ordered the roasted lamb loin with crispy pork belly . It was beautiful - - great presentation with cute little mushrooms . Tasted wonderful too . My boyfriend ordered the poached Maine lobster which he also enjoyed . For dessert , I tried the foie gras ice cream ( served with bread crumbs , sponge cake and strawberries ) - - thought it would be weird but the foie gras was subtle .

However I thought the food menu was just OK . it ' s probably seasonal so I didn ' t see some items I was interested in ordering after having checked reviews / photos on Yelp ( eg , the bone marrow beef shank pot pie ) . So I opted fo the pigs in a biscuit - - yes the biscuits were just the right amount of buttery and the pork crispy , but the accompaniments weren ' t amazing ( pickled salad and side of dijon - like mustard that I didn ' t think went well with the pork or biscuit ) and the pork was oozing with grease down my fingers after every bite .

      "Example 4957: First , bring cash because if you spend less than 20 you cannot use a credit / debit card . I was not told this until after I finished my meal . There was no sign stating this and the credit card logos ( visa / mastercard ) on the door would indicate that they take cards for payment for any amount but they do not . I had to use the \" convenient \" ATM inside the restaurant that charged me $ 2 . 50 . A total scam . Price was a little ridiculous for the amount of food . Big bowl but little noodle or toppings . I added the charsiu for $ 2 . 50 and got one piece . I ran a Sapporo Ramen Shop and we had set prices for different noodles and we did not charge for extra noodles or toppings because that is what a proper establishment does . Miso broth was very very salty , noodles were under cooked and toppings were skimpy . I thought the \" gyoza \" was priced adequately until I received them . Five small little balls . After everything was said and done my bill was $ 13 . 75 ( $ 16 . 25 if you charge the ATM Fee ) . I am normally a large tipper but I left a buck and some change and I still thought that was too much . Service was horrible . I had three different servers . One who took my order , one who brought me my food , and one who bought me my bill . The one who brought me my bill had the worst attitude . The white girl who said she cannot take my card and who said it was the owner who refuses to take charge cards if under $ 20 . I am pretty sure that it is illegal to not accept a tyoe of payment without posting there policies on the door . I will never ever go back to this place and I recommend that no one travels here . I have had better Ramen at the Mitsuwa Market and at a better price . Actually , don ' t take my word and go there for yourself and see how it really is .\n",

My salmon was overcooked , and had good seasonings , but definitely was not a $ 30 salmon entree . My Uncle ' s hamburger was undercooked , and he said not worth $ 20 .

The vegetables sometimes comes still frozen but cooks quickly on the hot platter . The individual - sized hot pots are my favorite on a chilly night . It comes with loads of veggies , fish balls , taro , tomatoes , corn , and other regular hot pot goodies . Your choice of beef , seafood , or mushrooms to dip in the pot once the soup boils . The broth eventually soaks up all of the goodness from the veggies & the meat and becomes very hearty & flavorful - warms your soul . The other stuff is only so - so - the basil fried rice is decent , the \" pad thai \" is not - greasy & overly sweet . The bento boxes are a great value - comes with rice , your choice of meat , 2 side dishes ( usually one veggie and one tofu ) and an egg - makes a great quick lunch or dinner . They also serve bubble teas and other sweetened tea drink . Generally I ' ve found their teas to be overly sweet so I always get them with half or 1 / 3 sugar .

IT WAS GOOD but overpriced . I think i would have been happier if the table hadnt had such picky eaters . the other family ' s kids we went with were picky and their kids wouldnt eat an alfredo sauce ! ! ! ! ? ? ? ? I would have loved to have the carbonara . This place is seriously overpriced for what you get . and its not even italian , its more like italian in an americana / chicago / new york subculture . . . . which is fine . but the soda was good .\n",

Who does that anymore ? Aldo ' s does . The waiter was fast , kind and accurate . Very personable young man named Michael . I was impressed with some birds I have never seen before flying around the harbor . I asked our waiter Michael if he knew the name of them . He did not , however he came back later to tell me the name of the odd looking little bird that made a peculiar sound . Apparently , he asked someone who knew the answer . I appreciated the fact that he went out of his way to find out for me . He also remembered my name \" Angel \" and told me to enjoy my birthday at the end of our meal . I am a stickler when it comes to Customer Service . I have trained many people for my old company Xerox so I expect the best wherever I go and Aldo ' s gives me just that . Great food made by someone that is obviously passionate about their cooking . Great scenery of the harbor and ocean and Great Customer Service ! What more can you ask for really ? Aldo ' s restaurant was featured on Diners , Drive - Ins and Dives with Guy Fieri ( Food Network ) so we had to go scope it out for ourselves , so glad we did . Thanks Guy Fieri ! We also went to Aldo ' s Italian Bakery Soquel , CA and once again the baked goods were delicious and the Customer Service Excellant . Those those Aldo ' s . They know what their doing . Treat yourself to some really good Italian food at Aldo ' s I recommend the homemade raviolis in marinara sauce . You will thank me later . Angel from The Bay Silicon Valley\n",
